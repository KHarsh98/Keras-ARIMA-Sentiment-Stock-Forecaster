            ","Q3 2018 Earnings Conference CallQ3 2018 Earnings Conference CallOct. 16, 2018,Good morning, and welcome to the UnitedHealth Group third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.Here's some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical different experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.This call will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the financial reports and SEC filing section of the company's investors page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning, and in our Form 8-K dated October 16, 2018, which may be accessed from the investors page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Mr. David Wichmann. Please go ahead. -- Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported strong operating and financial results across our enterprise. Those results provide a sense of the capacity to advance growth within our businesses. Capabilities rooted in the breadth and adaptability of our business approach and, above all, in our mission helping people living healthier lives and helping making the health system work better for everyone.Executing on this mission produces real value for the people we serve and for society in the U.S. and globally, through higher quality healthcare delivery, with better outcomes at lower costs, leading to improved consumer satisfaction. Executing on our mission also produces steadily advancing growth and financial value. Third quarter revenues grew 12% to $56.6 billion, and third quarter adjusted earnings per share grew 28% to $3.41. We now expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share to approach $12.80, growth of about 27%. This increases our outlook by $0.17 per share from the midpoint of our range last quarter.These results are grounded in persistently applying three core competencies -- information, technology, and clinical insights across our businesses. At no time in our history has our work in these three competencies held more promise than today, as they powerfully combine to unlock healthcare value for those we serve. We organize and align data, both clinical and administrative, around the healthcare consumer, using proprietary tools and technologies which evaluate data and care patterns against evidence-based guidelines.Comparing highly personalized data and best-known science, we offer next-best action for consumers, while providing them full transparency into the quality and costs of services offered by their local health systems. We engage our own clinical care resources as well, to directly support consumers' individual healthcare needs. We further use data to improve compliance with evidence-based medicine, raising overall satisfaction with care and reducing unnecessary resource consumption. We increasingly doing this through employed and affiliated integrated care teams, and in more ambulatory care settings, sharing this knowledge at critical points of decision making.Building and applying these competencies persistently to serve each individual we touch, the broader communities and societies we are a part of and you, our shareholders, requires thoughtful, continuing investment internally and in alignment with others through well-developed research and development venture and M&A capacity.You can see the broad impact of these competencies in each of our five growth pillars. In care delivery, we use data analytics in concert with our knowledge of local market clinical performance to get patients to the best doctors, care pathways, and sites of service for particular conditions, and to inform development of value-based care arrangements for our employed and affiliated care providers. Increasingly, these are shared risk and performance-based relationships. In consumer-centric health benefits, information is powering modern product designs to fortify performance networks, tools, and incentive programs to advance quality and engagement, and approving appropriate consumer access, while reducing the cost of healthcare.Specific examples include our new on-demand healthcare and Colorado Doctors plan offerings, and our designs for the duly eligible and Medicare Advantage participants. All of these hold promise for continued growth across our benefits businesses. You see it in pharmacy care services, where we have integrated medical and pharmacy information, and provide point-of-care technologies to simplify administration, improve drug selection and adherence, and reduce not only pharmacy cost, but medical care costs as well, all increasingly within the clinical workflow of doctors.You see it in digital health, where our consumer digital health platform, Rally, is now serving over 20 million registered users. Rally is synthesizing information and engaging people to better manage their health, helping consumers save money by selecting the highest quality care providers, understanding their out-of-pocket costs up front, and in some markets even scheduling appointments for care. We will soon be releasing at scale a first-of-kind, fully integrated and fully portable individual health record that delivers personalized next-best health actions to people and their caregivers.Finally, in global healthcare, we are bringing payment integrity, analytics, and network and product innovations to key private healthcare markets in South America, in support of both our health benefits businesses, as well as our extensive care delivery operations. These are just a few examples of how we deploy these core competencies in our businesses. Taken more broadly, they give you a sense of UnitedHealth Group's potential to drive distinctive, constructive change, sustained growth and performance for those we serve. Now, let me turn it to Andrew Witty to build on these comments and to update on our Optum businesses. Andrew? -- Thank you, Dave. Taking a mission and competency approach enables us to think more deeply and holistically about the healthcare landscape. At Optum, we are focused on building and developing a broad set of capabilities which support our vision of delivering better healthcare more affordably. We're still early in the journey of releasing the full potential of our assets, in both the digital and local care environments. Optum will lead by offering deeply customer focused, simple to access, high quality healthcare actions and options. We are seeing opportunities to build out our capabilities and are committed to stepping up our pace of innovation on behalf of our clients and consumers.Looking at third quarter results, our revenues grew $2.5 billion over last year to $25.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 11% from 9% in the second quarter. This revenue advance was again well balanced, with strong growth rates from both internal and unaffiliated customers consistent with recent quarters. Our metrics are indicative of this growth across the businesses. OptumRx fulfilled 331 million scrips in the quarter, generating revenue growth in excess of 9%; Optum Health served 92 million people with revenues increasing over 15%; and OptumInsight inside backlog grew nearly 13% to $15.7 billion at quarter end.Themes of productivity and operational excellence continued in the third quarter, as Optum's operating margin of 8% increased 60 basis points over last year, with each business strongly expanding operating margins year-over-year and sequentially. Earnings from operations grew $334 million, or nearly 20% to $2 billion, with strengths across OptumHealth, OptumInsight, and OptumRx. This continues a long-standing trend of proportionally greater Optum earnings in the second half of the year, and positions us well for 2019.The businesses of OptumHealth engage people in their health and wellbeing, help them manage their health conditions and increasingly provide care through our high-value clinicians and care delivery sites. Growth at OptumHealth continued to be led by the development of the care delivery businesses as a primary care driven, ambulatory care system. OptumCare provides primary care in 35 priority markets, and serves 80 health plans and 14 million people, up 2.6 million patients or 23% compared to a year ago. Patient growth was driven by increases in our high-value site-to-service businesses, and growth in our existing primary care markets. And yet, many of our local efforts remain in an early investment stage. Building out this high performing ambulatory care system will occupy us for the next decade, as we progressively deliver significantly improved outcomes, quality, and value to patients.At OptumInsight, we serve health plans, care providers, life science organizations, and governments with data analytics, insights, and innovative solutions to make better decisions and investments, and to better manage performance and quality in their cost structures. Over the past several years, we have focused on the further development and growth of our care provider services and capabilities, an area where we see meaningful opportunity. Here in particular, I note revenue management, outsourcing solutions, and data analytics and advisory services as important contributors to our recent growth.I'm enthusiastic about OptumRx and its differentiated, integrative, pharmacy care services approach. This business allows us increasingly to advance high quality, high value specialty pharmaceutical, e-commerce, and site-to-service initiatives, combined with convenient local market dispensing, all centered on whole-person care.Launching the nation's first-ever scaled application of pharmacy discounts at the point of sale will further improve the value consumers receive. We are actively supporting efforts at HHS and CMS to transform pharmacy pricing by engaging in Part B drug and site-to-service management, form the reapproaches and other initiatives to bring better healthcare value to people. OptumRx is becoming increasingly diversified and capable, meeting consumers where their needs are greatest. With growing contribution from specialty medical management to directly serving high-needs patients with critical access and [inaudible] services, through community-based dispensing and delivery, to offering fulfillment services for limited distribution specialty drugs.I see OptumRx as a champion of the consumer in an area where it's difficult for individuals to have a truly effective voice. Through our depths of insight, data, and clinical capabilities, we can help inform and amplify their voice. Within our pharmacy care services approach stands an immense opportunity to transform what has been a challenging area of the health system, and positively impact people's lives.While it's early in my time at Optum, I'm struck by the sheer size and depth of the opportunity, resources, and capacity Optum has to drive extraordinary innovation across healthcare, making people healthier, and helping make healthcare systems work better. After more than three decades in healthcare, I've never seen an organization with the potential of Optum. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Nelson, UnitedHealthcare CEO. -- Thank you, Andrew. UnitedHealthcare's market position is supported by a foundation of consumer value, drawn from the breadth and diverse array of health benefit choices, competitive costs, distinctive care quality, and market responsive consumer service. Together, these deliver stability, peace of mind, and value to the nearly 50 million people we serve. Our agenda is to drive a higher NPS and increased value by advancing our service experience, market-leading innovations, and the total cost of care. Our approach and mindset across the enterprise enable UnitedHealthcare to serve each individual with compassion, while addressing the evolving healthcare needs of society, driving growth and returns for shareholders.In the third quarter, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew to $45.9 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion over last year, and accelerating to 13% growth. Over the past 12 months, we have been privileged to serve 2.8 million more people by way of organic growth and an expanded presence in South America. UnitedHealthcare's earnings from operations were $2.6 billion, with a 5.6% operating margin. Overall, medical costs trends remain well managed, predictable, and consistent with expectations.In operations, we're delivering a better and more modern consumer and care provider experience, while driving productivity and affordability improvements in our cost structure through technology, better processes, and the benefits of growth and scale. In UnitedHealthcare, Medicare, and retirement, we continued to innovate and grow. UnitedHealthcare served 125,000 more people through Medicare Advantage offerings in the third quarter, including the 65,000 members of Peoples Health in Louisiana, the highest Medicare Star Quality plan in that state. We expect strong growth again next year.With the 2019 marketing season now under way, we're receiving positive feedback on our new offerings from brokers and consumers. This year, more than 50 million people nationwide will have a choice of multiple plans from UnitedHealthcare. We're emphasizing our stability and value for seniors. Well more than 90% of our current Medicare Advantage members, more than 4.5 million people, will see either no premium increase or a premium decrease, even as we provide personalized navigation, introduce new value-added benefits at no additional cost, and increase and modernize access for seniors to fitness and wellness services, virtual visits, and reliable transportation for medical appointments.Today, Medicare Advantage programs serve only about 20 million people nationally in a growing senior population of 60 million people. We deliver Medicare medical benefits at an average cost that is more than 20% lower than original Medicare, with costs in our higher-performing markets as much as 30% below original Medicare. We convert these cost advantages into highly valued benefits and services for seniors, filling the significant gaps in coverage within original Medicare. Our programs focused on higher acuity populations like Medicare Advantage remain an extraordinary growth opportunity for UnitedHealthcare, because we can offer such strong value.UnitedHealthcare employer and individual grew to serve 65,000 more people through risk-based commercial products in the third quarter. Our growing market share and fully insured products in recent years reflects our rising NPS with customers, consumers, care provider partners, and our distribution partners. Strong customer retention rates and the increasing value we deliver with consumer-centric products, tailored networks, and greater consumer engagement are important drivers of growth. In 2019 and 2020, we expect to introduce additional products supported by performance networks, and will launch advanced digital capabilities providing even greater personalization, simplicity, and value for consumers.In UnitedHealthcare Community and State, growth over the past year was led by higher need, and therefore higher revenue membership, such as those who are duly eligible to participate in long-term services and support programs. Medicaid membership grew organically by 5,000 people in the quarter, offset by the divestiture of our plan, representing 85,000 community-based members in New Mexico. We continue to focus on delivering value to our state partners by advancing health, and improving our total cost of care and operating cost positions in Medicaid.At UnitedHealthcare Global, our integrated delivery systems, primary care health center model and progressive use of information and technology are creating value for our customers in South America. We continue our disciplined approach of pricing health benefits to their expected costs, and our hospitals in Brazil continue to improve their performance, as measured by health outcomes, NPS, and financial returns.UnitedHealthcare Global is creating value with our Banmédica colleagues in Chile, Peru, and Colombia, with early progress in population health management, clinical management, and analytic capabilities. Initial focus areas include the adoption of evidence-based clinical guidelines, and site of care strategies for high-utilizing patients.Looking ahead, we expect sustained, strong growth and improved earnings performance from UnitedHealthcare. Our investments in innovative products, capabilities, and the consumer experience will increasingly be brought to market, even as we focus on delivering market-leading total cost of care. And we believe UnitedHealthcare is uniquely positioned to serve in the high growth, higher acuity submarkets like Medicare, [inaudible], or patients with complex and chronic conditions. Now I'll turn the call over to John Rex, UnitedHealth group's Chief Financial Officer. -- Thank you, Steve. To bring all the previous comments together, this morning we reported $56.6 billion in third quarter revenue, growth of 12.4% over last year. Earnings from operations of $4.6 billion grew 12.3% on strong operating margins of about 8%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% to $3.41. Third quarter adjusted cash flows were $6.1 billion, or 1.9x net income. Of note, we made a $2.6 billion payment to the U.S. Treasury on October 1 for our customers' portion of the nation's health insurance tax for 2018, which will factor into our fourth quarter cash flow results.With 9 months of 2018 complete, our original outlook for commercial medical cost trend of 6%, plus or minus 50 basis points, is biasing just slightly lower than 6%. In the third quarter, our consolidated medical care ratio of 81% compares to 81.4% in the year-ago quarter and reflects the impact of the health insurance tax, offset by changes in business mix and development.Medical reserves developed favorably in the quarter by $50 million. Within that result, we had approximately $120 million of favorable development for 2018, and $70 million in unfavorable prior-year development. Our third quarter operating cost ratio of 15% increased only 30 basis points over last year, despite bearing about 1 percentage point of cost increase from the return of the health insurance tax, as well as higher investments in innovation and business development. We offset that pressure with operating expense discipline across the board, and strong revenue growth in lower operating cost ratio businesses, such as Medicare and Medicaid.Turning to our balance sheet. Return on equity for the third quarter reached nearly 26%, and our debt-to-total capital ratio was 38.9% at September 30. We have repurchased $3.7 billion of stock year-to-date for approximately $233 per share, and we continue to apply capital to our businesses through M&A, venture investments, and organic development to strengthen our offerings for customers and further diversify our enterprise. Taken together, our strong and diversified growth, disciplined cost management, and strategic use of capital are combining to produce another year of meaningful financial performance. As Dave mentioned, we now expect 2018 adjusted earnings approaching $12.80 per share, growth of approximately 27%. Dave? -- Thank you, John. As we close out the third quarter, attention naturally turns to 2019. We will reserve the majority of this conversation for our November 27 investor conference, but I can offer a few high-level observations at this time. The environment in 2019 will contain, as always, a mix of elements common to the broad marketplace and those unique to us. Overall, our individual businesses are building from a fundamentally strong foundation, and we continue to create strong momentum heading into next year.We will continue to advance NPS, supporting continued growth across our businesses. Our accelerating investment levels will fund the delivery of compelling innovations into 2019 and 2020. As we evaluate the many opportunities we see over the next number of years, we believe our long-term performance will remain aligned with our long-term goal of earnings-per-share growth of 13% to 16%.We enter 2019 with energy and optimism for the future. I would offer at this distance the current market consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share captures our 2019 outlook within a typically sized range. As always, we will seek to perform to our full potential. Advancing distinctive, constructive change in healthcare is an enormous and complex undertaking. We believe we have a lot to offer, advancing more value for consumers while mitigating costs for those who pay for care.Our strategies do not depend or reside on a single piece of technology, database, distribution system, clinical approach, funding mechanism, or any other singular view of what it takes to make a durable and meaningful difference in healthcare. Rather, our potential resides in a combination of our diverse market presence, our data, technology, and clinical competencies, the compassion, integrity, and deep healthcare knowledge and skills of our nearly 300,000 people, the millions of trust relationships we have earned over time, and our understanding of and full alignment to the rapidly advancing standards of performance that individuals and health systems worldwide demand from their healthcare.Our people, and this deeply motivated, diverse, and adaptable leadership team are fully engaged in improving value for society and delivering consistent, distinctive financial results. Let me close now and open up the call to your questions. One question per person, please, so we can respond to everyone in the queue this morning.At this time, if you have a question or comment, please press * and 1 on your touchtone phone. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the # key. Again, we ask you to limit to one question, so we can get to as many participants as possible. Thank you.We'll take our first question from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead; your line is open. -- Thank you, good morning. If you could comment on our outlook for the Medicare open enrollment season. Just within that, the trend in 2018 has been very heavily skewed in favor of the large public companies. I'm wondering if you can comment on that as it relates to prior years, and if you expect that to continue. Thank you. -- Matt, thank you for your question. Obviously, it's an area of strength for our organization. We have performed exceptionally well in growing in the Medicare Advantage market. Both the individual, as well as the serving group accounts, as well. It took a lot of planning and execution. Our team is very strong in that regard. I think we expect a very nice result to develop for 2019 as well. Let me ask Brian Thompson to add to that. -- Thanks, Dave. Brian Thompson here. Yeah, Matthew, '19 is shaping up as a really great year, I think for seniors at large and the MA industry specifically. We are certainly optimistic about our products and how they compare. What we're seeing in the marketplace is consistent with our expectation and certainly gives us confidence about our positioning. We expect to drive another very strong year of MA growth and continue our momentum that we've demonstrated now for several years. I think as we approach the year, what we're seeing in the marketplace looks like what we had expected. I'm very pleased with our position. Really no surprises, and I think you can expect more growth from us in 2019. -- All right. Thank you. -- Next question, please.We'll go next to Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead; your line is open. -- Thanks. First on that, I apologize. On the Medicare Advantage, the CMS is estimating 11.5% growth for next year. I'm just curious if you agree with that. And then my question is really on the TBM side. You acquired two specialty pharmacies in the quarter. I wanted to get your updated view on the PBM business, given all the debate in the sector around the sustainability of margins and economics in general, and the future of rebates in particular. -- Thank you, Justin. Of course, we have our own points of view about what we expected the growth rate to be in the Medicare Advantage market. Of course, CMS's number was quite a bit higher than that. I think we'll still indexed on a lower expectation, but we certainly would be pleased to see that growth rate overall. Brian, if you have anything to add to that? -- No, I think you said it right, Dave. As we said in previous quarters, we look at the long-term industry growth rate for MA more in that 7% to 8% range, as I said last quarter, Justin. Our planning is certainly to outpace that rate, as we have now for four or five years. As Dave said, a lot of optimism, but a lot of ranges around what the growth rate might be for 2019. I don't think it'll be instructive for us to chime in on what that percentage might be, but certainly optimistic. Certainly reasons for it to strengthen and we're pleased with how we're positioned as we approach '19. -- A very insightful question also, Justin, on the specialty pharma acquisitions. We are very excited about those. There's a lot of adaptability for those across multiple aspects of our business. Andrew Witty, would you like to comment? -- Yeah, thanks, Dave. Again, thanks for the question. Yes, during the quarter, we acquired both Avella and Genoa, both of which are going to be potentially very important additions to our specialty pharmacy portfolio. They've made a very small contribution in the quarter itself. But going forward, we see them offering distinctive contributions in the behavioral space, as well in the specialty, particularly in the oncology space.To your more general question around the role and the importance of PBMs, I think it's important to reflect on really the fundamental role the PBM offers, which is to aggregate volume and to ensure a pricing discipline within the pharmaceutical sector, without which there really wouldn't be any kind of discipline around drug price increasing. As you know, drug companies are free to increase drug prices at will. The PBM acts as a mechanism to discipline that process. Historically, that's been through the rebating mechanism.As we look forward, we're ready for whatever evolution of that marketplace might take place. The diversification of the OptumRx portfolio into a really diversified portfolio of pharmacy services is really displayed in its continued growth rate. Development of the Briova infusion business is one example. We've seen a significant set of positive evolution there.To the degree to which there is change in the PBM environment, I come back to my first point. It's critical that any environment ensures that there is a disciplining mechanism for price increases in the U.S., and whether that's through rebates or any other mechanism, we're ready to engage with whatever changes might come along. -- Justin, I may just add. You probably noticed, or the markets have noticed a pivot for us from a PBM to a pharmacy care services-based business. I know we've been talking about that for some time, but more increasingly, over the course of the last couple years or so, with Andrew here, Andrew Witty, he's taken and actually modernized and advanced that approach even more so for us, really enhancing our thinking in this area. I think what you can expense from us is that we'll be deeply thoughtful about how we engage and participate broadly, but also have confidence that we will navigate through this change, similar to the way we have across our changes in healthcare in the past. Next question, please.We'll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. I want to go back to MA, if I can. And really just thoughts about the margins, the sustainability in that business. It seems like every company is really looking to grow MA as a key driver going forward. Every company seems to have talked about growing faster than the industry. I think CMS's comments about an 11.5% number is, to some degree, driven by the view that companies are largely improving benefits, which all else equal, I guess would imply margin compression. So, I would just love to hear your thoughts about how competitive that marketplace is and the ability to maintain margins and grow the way that you're targeting over time. -- That's a great question, Kevin. Obviously, we have great confidence in our ability to sustain our margins and continue to grow the business. It has always been a competitive marketplace and clearly there is a lot of new entrants into that market as well. I think those entrants in the competitive field make us just that much better. We've had some distinctive capacities in this category, and I think that's what makes us different and really enhances our ability to continue to grow and sustain margins by creating real value. I'll ask Brian Thompson, once again, to comment on maybe what some of those capacities are and provide further context. -- Sure. Thanks, Dave. As Dave said, certainly pleased with the outlook for what we see in 2019, but I certainly want to point out the strong momentum that we've demonstrated. This is the fourth year of outpacing the industry growth rate quite meaningfully. I think it's a signal that our value is resonating in the marketplace. Over the last four years, benefit stability, as well as the enhancements we've added, our focus on a hassle-free agenda; taking out the complications for those we serve; our service model, which we call our advocate-for-me service model; our very popular household program; the various care management programs we have; all virtually Optum-enabled. They're really resonating. And we're seeing that value with our members. With our physician partners, and our distribution channel at large. We're really pleased to have that sort of track record and momentum as we answer what's appearing to be a very optimistic season for seniors. -- Thank you, Kevin. Next question, please.Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.-- Hi, good morning. I wanted to shift over to OptumCare. I'm wondering how many markets do you have substantial buildout where say a material portion of your benefit spend on the UnitedHealthcare side in those service areas where you choose to compete would be flowing through OptumCare. What kind of savings do you see from using OptumCare? And then how do you foresee the buildout of subsequent markets, of more markets to that level of influence? -- That's a great question, Dave. I think the script covered some of that when we were referring to Medicare Advantage products, in particular the value that are created relative to original Medicare and we were talked about the upper limits of that being the 30% or so savings category. That's really what we're referring to is the deep relationships that UnitedHealthcare, and frankly others have with the OptumCare enterprise, which is a fiercely multi-payer business. So, serving many payers, as we outlined in the script as well. We have Andrew Hayek here. He'll answer the balance of your questions. -- Thanks, Dave. To add to what Dave shared, just high level, we're really pleased with the performance of OptumCare in terms of improving quality, measured by Stars, HEDIS measures, our consumer experience. We're average a Net Promoter score of 71 across OptumCare and OptumHealth. And the total cost of care savings, savings to the system by driving better health, by preventing avoidable admissions, by practicing evidence-based care. To Dave's point, when we do these things, we're seeing savings in the order of magnitude of 30% compared to traditional Medicare in a growing number of our mature markets. As was referenced earlier, we're present in 30 markets across OptumCare.There are varying levels of depth in those markets, but all of them are on the pathway toward value. Value-based contracting, value-based clinical programs, culture, how we orient our positions. We're deepening our presence in those communities that we serve. Again, at different points along the continuum, but we're all deepening and growing. And we're optimistic. We're in the early stages, as Andrew Witty shared, of the potential of OptumCare. As we generate these kinds of results for the communities we serve, the patients we serve, and our 80 health plan partners, we see continued and growing interest to enter new markets, and to deepen our presence in our current markets. -- Thank you for the question, Dave. Next question, please.We'll go to Sarah James with Piper Jaffrey. Please go ahead; your line is open. -- Thank you. I wanted to go back to your comment on 2019, being within the range of the long-term growth, which you've previously said was 13% to 16%. So, there were bullish comments on Medicare and Optum growth, then we have the HIF break, so stacking up to be more tailwinds than headwinds. Can you run us through headwinds or tailwinds that may be missing from that and spike out the impact of the HIF tailwind? I think this year it was $0.75 headwind to '18, so how much is it rolling off for the benefit to '19? Thanks. -- Sure, Sarah. Thank you. So maybe what I'll give you a sense of is the generally speaking, the headwinds and tailwinds as we see, and then I'll ask John Rex to cover the HIF, which I'm sure there's a lot of interest in. Generally, headwinds end up being matters that are less specific to us, so I'll call them industry-related headwinds, but we certainly have things that are unique to us as well. I think it's really important always as we think about planning, and we're in the midst of it right now, that we always start with a deep respect for medical costs, and also around positioning in a conservative posture on pricing to ensure that we fully consider those medical costs in that pricing.Next to that, I'd say the sufficiency of government funding is always of concern, specifically in an environment where budgets begin to tighten and our population continues to age. That's going to put pressure broadly on budgets. Our response to that is to continue our extensive advocacy activities that we have in this area to ensure that the voices of those that depend on Medicare and Medicaid are heard and well heard.At the same time, you've heard a lot of conversation this morning around managing total cost of care and being very restless around driving greater value to the market. So, we clearly respond to the sufficiency of government funding call by making sure that costs are contained, and that consumers, Medicare consumers in particular, receive additional value for their premium dollars.The health insurer fee tax is an interesting item. I'll give my take on it first, and then as I said, I'll ask John at the end to comment on it as well. But I see it as a negative. I see it's return as a negative for people, for the industry, for business, for society broadly. If it returns, the industry is going to need to once again build it into premiums. That's going to elevate them to a point of dissatisfaction among consumers. We saw that when it came back here for 2018, in particular. It affects our NPS. It causes unnecessary instability for those we serve, particularly our Medicare members who are on fixed incomes.Beyond that, the rest of the items are pretty unique to us. But I'd call out one in particular, which is around the pacing of investments. As you know, we have NPS ambitions in this company. We have growth ambitions in this company. We have ideals around how we can add value to the health system broadly over time. So, we have new R&D. Our research and development capacities. You heard us talk about a lot of start-up-based businesses. OptumCare is still a start-up; probably midstream in its overall development. Something that will take nearly two decades to fully develop. But you also heard us talk about things like buying the Colorado's Doctors plan.While we didn't talk about it today, we are also entering into new geographic markets for Medicare, and also for our commercial-based business. All of those things take deep investment. But they're investments that are necessary in order to sustain that long-term, and I underscore long-term growth rate of 13% to 16% over time. You're absolutely right. We have a lot of tailwinds and they surpassed our headwinds, and that's why we can offer up the strength of that 2019 guidance that we have. Those include advances in NPS, cost containment, and the innovation that's a hallmark of this company. All those things continue to fuel growth.We expect a strong year of Medicare Advantage, as you heard from Brian. But we also expect continued strong growth in returns from our market competitive commercial offerings. As I said, last quarter we were a bit dissatisfied with our ability, particularly in the national accounts market, to advance our self-funded business. I think that's going to pivot in 2019 and begin to produce growth in 2020. Our Medicaid businesses do very well on the duals, and with the long-term services in sports populations, I think they can perform a lot better with the base Medicaid plans as well.OptumCare is going to enter into more new markets. It's going to also advance its risk-bearing capacities. We talked about OptumRx. They had a successful selling season again this year, but it has a lot of momentum, particularly in specialty, and delivering considerable supply chain value. OptumInsight is performing really well revenue cycle management and cost containment lines, and our global businesses continue to expand across both insurance and delivery.We're going to continue to deploy capital in the business and grow, as you've come to expect from us in the past. So sustaining all that really requires a significant investment. What we do is we thoughtfully plan about what investment capacities we have, so that we can invest and continue to sustain that kind of 13% to 16% long-term earnings growth rate over time. Our idea is to provide the maximum return possible for society, and then also our shareholders.With that, maybe I'll ask John just to touch on the mechanics of the HIF tax as well. -- Sure. Sarah, good morning. Just a few components here as we think about the HIF tax and our view on it and expectations going into next year that might be instructive. I think the first thing to recall is when we laid out our initial $0.75 back in November, that was prior to a very important event that occurred later on, which was the reduction in the corporate tax rate. That meaningfully muted the impact, the headwind impact of the health insurance headwind for us this year. I know you're aware of that one. That's a significant reduction.There are other true-ups and miscellaneous items as the year goes on, but far and away, that would be the biggest component. So, with 9 months of actuals now, we sized the 2018 year-over-year headwind just over half the level or around half the level we'd initially expected back then. Again, vast majority of that just due to the corporate tax reduction. As we start considering things and elements for 2019, among things we'll have to consider and be watchful for is when and how any conclusions are made for the reintroduction of the tax in 2020 also, as that would have impact on the 2019 view. So, all elements will be in play, but I just want to also provide a little guidance on where we think it's, the impact we think it's had in 2018 also. -- Thanks for the question, Sarah. You got probably more than you asked for in the answer, but we hope we were very thorough. -- That's fantastic; thank you. -- Thank you. Next question, please.And we'll go next to Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. -- Josh, you may be on mute. Josh, are you on mute?We'll move on. We can go to Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thanks a lot. Looking for an update on the shift from fee-for-service to fee-for-value, both in terms of where you guys are at now, as well as on the OptumInsight side, the systems that you're delivering to aid providers and payers in that move. -- Okay. Well, I think the shift from fee-for-service to fee-for-value, I'll have Dan Schumacher, President of UnitedHealthcare discuss. Then maybe, Andrew, if you want to tie into that as well. -- Sure. Thank you, Michael, for the question. To your good point, we have long been pursuing the transition on greater orientation toward value over volume. We're doing it in a couple of ways. First, trying to get an increasing amount of spend under value-based constructs, but then importantly, second, working to make sure that spend migrates toward managing the health of the population, versus just individual quality metrics. As you think about each of those components on the amount overall, today we have about $69 billion in value-based constructs. That represents a little under half of our medical/surgical spend. We had set a goal to get to $65 billion, and we got there early. So, we've reset our sights toward $75 billion by 2020. So, we'll continue to progress the total volume of spend that comes under value-based constructs.Then inside that, we've been very successful in that migration toward a population orientation. If you look at where that sits today, about half of our value-based spend is in the more progressive relationships that orient around population outcomes. That's up from about 38% to 39%, if we look just five years ago. So, we've got a lot of focus around deepening those partnerships. Some of our most progressive relationships are actually with our ACO partners. In those relationships, we work to share data, share insights, drive better coordination, close gaps in care for people, and as you look at that, we've had some very successful outcomes with our ACO partners. In total, we've got about 1,000 ACOs under way. As you look at it across Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial, we're able to drive less inpatient stays, lower readmission rates, less primary care, less ER, and more preventative screening. So, overall, we're pleased with our progress there, and we continue to do more work, and we look to build on it in future. -- I think you know, Andrew Hayek and his team at OptumCare in particular are enabling all this by putting the deep infrastructure in local markets, from primary care to development of ambulatory care systems to enable the other side of that coin, if you will, that Dan has just described. So, having heard from Andrew, I think we'll just go to Eric Murphy for some comments on the OptumInsight side. -- Thanks, Dave. Thanks for the question, Michael. Just picking up on what Dan Schumacher shared, is payers and providers continue to shift from fee-for-service to value-based care arrangements. OptumInsight offers the market what we refer to as a plan-build model. On the plan side, we've got one of the largest advisor consulting services organizations in the healthcare industry, where a number of our subject matter experts assist payers and providers with how to build those arrangements so they can move from fee-for-service to value-based care. On the build side, we have Optum Performance Analytics, which we've talked about many times on this call in the past. It is one of the market-leading platforms to enable payers and providers to not only establish risk-based relationships, but really manage both the cost and quality of care. But we see a continued shift in the marketplace from fee-for-service to value-based care, and feel very strong about the enablement capabilities of OptumInsight. -- Thanks. -- Thank you. Next question, please.We'll go next to Zach Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on your experience now with point-of-sale rebates. I think it was about six months ago that you announced that you were going to do it for 2019 for your risk book. How have those clients been taking it? Are they understanding what has to be done to convert to that, and have you seen any increased interest in your fee-based book, in going to point-of-sale rebates for 2019? -- Thanks for the question, Zack. It's obviously a very timely one as well, given all the news around this. We did back in the beginning of March this year make a decision for the 7 to 8 million people that are in our fully insured employer base business to convert them to a point-of-sale rebate format. I'll ask Dan Schumacher to comment on that. Then John Prince, if you have any observations about how the market is adopting these ideals as well, I'd appreciate it. Dan? -- Good morning, Zack. So we did, as Dave mentioned, we announced our change earlier this year. That actually goes into effect beginning 1/1/2019 for all new and renewing groups forward in our fully insured group portfolio. So, at this point, it's coming up on 1/1/19, where we'll see that roll into place. The reaction from our customer base and the broker community has been strong. I think it adds a level of transparency to consumers and helps to return the economic incentive associated with the rebates to them at the point of sale, and that's particularly important when people are in high-deductible offerings where they're sharing the first-dollar burden of healthcare more broadly.As it relates to our self-funded client base, we continue to see more interest in that offering. Obviously, they're trying to think about how it all balances out in the context of how they set their contribution strategy, their benefit strategy that underpins that. But we have seen some more interest. We've seen some take-up in sales. Let's see if John Prince can offer anything from his perspective. -- Sure, Dan. Thanks. This is John Prince. In terms of the broader market, we've seen good uptake. We've been doing this in the market for several years in terms of our large, sophisticated clients. We've seen a real sea change this past year, first with UnitedHealthcare doing it in their fully insured book. We have an additional million lives that are picking up in the self-insured market. We also have additional health plan clients that are going to adopt it later in 2019-2020. In terms of a consumer experience, we're seeing a value of about $150 of value delivered back to an individual consumer when they have a point-of-sale rebate. Specifically on the high-deductible high plans, there's a lot of value from a consumer experience of doing point-of-sale rebates. But overall, a very solid uptake. -- Great. Thank you. Thank you for the question, Zack. Next question, please.We'll go next to AJ Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. -- Hi, everybody. I might take a minute to ask you about our MLR trend in the quarter. You were 81%. That was better than we were thinking, and I think better than the consensus. A couple of moving parts there. I guess I'd be interested to hear your comment on first if there's any way to flush out a little bit more granularity between the business lines and what you saw on MLR, whether one particularly outperformed or was there any area where you had any issues? And second, I guess, in that the development, we knew that you would not have probably as strong a development as you had last year, but we didn't really assume that you have actually the negative of developments that you had in 2017, related to 2017. Any comment on that? Then I think finally, as MLR trends impact, I think last quarter you highlighted that we should be aware that Latin America, particularly Banmédica, have a negative MLR impact in the second and third quarter because of the winter, and it's hard to see that in the combined results. I wonder if that played out like you expected, or did you have some unusual favorable trend down there? -- Thanks, AJ. All good questions. In the interest of time, it's just a seasonal adjustment in South America. So, they're moving into the spring and summer months now. So, we'll definitely see that as we move into Q4 and into Q1. John Rex, would you like to comment on our performance on MLR and development? -- Good morning, AJ. John Rex here. Yeah, just a few comments on that. I'm going to try to pick up the various components there, and hopefully I'll hit on them all. One element I heard you refer to was development in the quarter. So, net $50 million of favorable development in the quarter, and within that we talked about $120 million of that being in year and $70 million of that relating to prior years. Nothing really significant within those prior-year components I would tell you. The way we look at that, that's roughly on $130 billion of medical spend from 2017. So, very modest within the scheme of things. There's always different quarters in the year.You get coordination of benefits impact. You get other little impacts that come in. But within the scheme of our medical spend itself, .05%. So, relatively modest. I look back a little past through years, so 70 this year is 110 favorable. In '17, it was $110 million unfavorable. In '16, a very small amount that rolled through there, and nothing significant that I'd point out. In terms of across the lines of business, also nothing really meaningful to point out across the different lines. If I were to bias it a little bit, I'd bias it just slightly to the employer-based businesses in terms of where some of that development was occurring in the course of the quarter.You probably heard me comment during my prepared comments that we were biasing our trend outlook in commercial down a bit. Within that, in terms of trend, we continue to see really what's driving most of trend is still unit cost as the main driver versus utilization. If I were to break down the components in terms of what we're seeing versus what we staked out back in November in terms of the individual trend components, I'd characterize that probably pharmacy and inpatient are coming in at the low end of the expected ranges that we provided at that time. -- Hopefully that was responsive. AJ, thank you for the question. Next question, please.We'll go next to Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. --  Good morning, guys. Let me just follow up with that on the commercial side. First, it sort of sounds as those medical costs trend may have decelerated during the quarter. Is that a fair read? And if so, can you comment on where you're seeing the change in the secondary, if not for the buckets you listed? Then also just benefit on any preliminary comments on how the '19 selling season is shaping up in the commercial book, and maybe a little bit of our outlook for the cost trend moving forward? -- Stephen, John Rex here again. So, yeah, with regard to the buckets I think is what was you were asking in terms of trend. The components we're seeing against our initial expectations we laid out back in November were really pharmacy and inpatient, in terms of coming in at the lower end of the range. As relates to inpatient, it's been a very long-term decline in inpatient. I think we've had 9 years or so of declining inpatient utilization. So, that has been a long-term trend. But those components where the buckets were, we're seeing the lower end of the range and where we've seen some deceleration. -- I don't think we're in any different place in trend on MLR this quarter versus where we were last. There's no watershed moment that occurred in the Q3. I think it's intensely consistent in terms of overall performance, as well as we look at how we select our reserves and the development that comes as a result. Dan, do you want to pick up the last piece? -- Thanks, Steve. I think you asked about how the '19 selling season was shaping up. I assume that orients toward the self-funded marketplace, just given where we sit in the year. Maybe I'll break that into a couple of pieces. As it relates to first the national account market segment, as I've shared for the last couple of quarters, the theme there is really one around incumbency. We've done well to win when given the opportunity, but the reality is we do have a larger base that we're defending inside that. We were successful again this year in converting our retirees to group Medicare offerings. Obviously, those are a strong value for clients and consumers, as well as for our enterprise.So, for the self-funded portion of the national accounts segment, we do expect enrollment to decline in 2019. Our team is really focused on, as Dave mentioned, redoubling our efforts around total cost of care. Importantly, our effectiveness in demonstrating that clearly to clients and consultants. As you look at the broader self-funded market, we continue to perform very well in the middle market segment, so clients with employees up to 3,000. And our public sector performance has seem some very nice improvement for 2019, including some large wins. So when we put that all together and look at the self-funded market overall, we expect some very strong year-over-year improvement, and that should result in a modest growth profile in 2019. We'll look forward to breaking apart the pieces and discussing it further at the investor conference in November. -- Thank you, Steve. We have several calls left in the queue and I'd like to see if we can get through this in the next 15 minutes or so. So, we're going to go ahead and take the next question, but you'll probably hear us tighten up our responses a bit here. Next question, please.We'll go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead; your line is open. -- Thanks, good morning. I just want to get a little more clarification on the HIF. Seemingly you priced it through to customers, and it sounds like obviously the tax benefit came after. So, is it sort of the mindset that you expect to pay it back in 2019? Is that why it might not be the sort of magnitude of tailwind we initially thought? Or help us think through that. Thanks. -- John Rex? -- Yeah, Ralph. So, in terms of -- are you focusing on the 2019 aspect? Or my comments were specifically related to 2018 and the impacts that the reduction in the corporate tax rate had. -- That benefited to you essentially in 2018 versus when you priced the book. So in 2019, are customers asking for that back? How do we think that through? -- That was a significant headwind. That's part of what came into our earnings outlook when we revised earnings in January. So, that was a meaningful part of that. Then we did not have to then price on renewing books, have to price that in to any renewing books that were coming on at that point. So, a significant benefit for our customers in terms of how we approach the market, and how we were able to pass on that benefit to our customers. Certainly, that's also a benefit that our customers are receiving in 2019 because of the absence of the HIF. We would hope to also have that benefit as we move into future years. As Dave pointed out, the mere existence of the health insurance tax is a headwind for healthcare costs. So, we look for that to accrue to our customers. -- Thank you, Ralph. Next question, please.We'll go next to Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, I've got just a question on PBM. It's kind of three short points, but very tight, don't worry. The first one is if you could talk about the mail penetration rate and how you're doing with specially steerage there, how they contrast with prior years? And I guess related to that, how you're thinking about e-commerce and potentially adding online pharmacy options like Amazon. Then within the context of that, if you want to talk a little bit about PBM sales for 2019, both direct and the cross-sales for the large, self-funded groups. Thanks. -- Thank you. I'll direct it straight to John Prince. -- Great, Lance. John Prince. I'll cover the selling season first. We're just wrapping up the 2019 selling season. If you look at the season, we had additional RFP volumes, so it was up year-over-year. In terms of clients sold, we've actually sold more clients in 2019 for a business that we did in 2018 selling season. So, we have additional clients year-over-year. This was in line with our expectations. So, we're excited about our sales. We've had a couple good state wins, a couple next health plans, unions, as well as a couple large employers. Retention is also very solid as we look into '19. We're going to have retention of 98% or higher as we go into 2019, which is three years in a row of solid retention.In terms of the other part of your question, which is mail penetration, especially in e-commerce. That has really been the driver of our growth over the last year is we've been increasing our mail penetration, driving additional specialty volume. We've been very successful in winning the open market. Remember, the biggest volume of business in specialty infusion is open source in terms of competing in the market. We've done a great job of getting the salesforce out there, competing with a great product, solid NPS from a consumer standpoint and from a physician standpoint. We're just winning better day in, day out in terms of in the market, and that's been driving our growth. -- Thank you for the question, Lance. Next question, please.We'll go next to Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Thanks. We've seen a few recent data points suggesting that the trend toward high-deductible plans in the employer business maybe slowing or even peaking. Is that something you're seeing? And do you think there's a certain point where employers have already exercised that high-deductible for new benefit design options? What would that look like? Are you seeing any pickup in interest in things like narrower, high-value networks, medical and pharmacy integration, digital and wellness tools, things like that? -- You just hit up on all the I think some of the primary growth drivers and what a lot of employers are looking for in healthcare. High-deductible health plans have been one of the fastest growing product lines out there for some time now, having been first introduced back all the way into 2004, I guess it was, or maybe 2003, maybe even earlier than that, for that matter. But the items you just pointed out are the same items that we also labeled in the script.Our work around digital technologies, providing deeply personalized information to consumers, the way in which we drive value-based arrangements, connect incentives across both the continuum of care, but also between healthcare consumers, and healthcare providers that is all, those are all essential parts of what employers are looking for. They're also looking for tighter levels of integration too. They're expecting that not only from our benefits business, but they're also expecting it from our services business, particularly as we get into healthcare delivery.That's where the technical solutions and information solutions that OptumInsight offers to both OptumRx, as well as to OptumHealth, really deeply respond to the demands of that marketplace. Frankly, they transcend employer into the Medicare and Medicaid market as well. Next question, please.We'll go next to Charles Wright with Cowen. Please go ahead; your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on earlier comments, when you were talking about point-of-sale rebates. Just trying to get a sense on are you guys passing back 100% of rebates to the member at the point of sale, or is it maybe some portion of it? Because my understanding is there's some concerns perhaps from PBMs themselves. If you pass back 100%, the retailers can backtrack into what your rebate arrangements are like. Can you give us a sense of a little bit more of the mechanics on how the process works? Then related to that, as this market evolves in the PBM space, are you looking at, can you talk about what types of new pricing models you're exploring with clients? Perhaps going more at-risk on price in a PMPM model? Thanks. -- Dan, do you want to take the point-of-sale rebate piece? Because I believe that relates to UnitedHealthcare's healthcare effort effective 1/1/19, and what percentage of that gets passed back through, which is the vast majority of it sans a hold-back for some of the work that we do as well. But anyway, anything further to add to that, Dan? -- No. -- Okay, great. Thanks. Sorry to drain that for you. John Prince, do you want to comment on the second part? -- Sure. Thank you for the question, Charles, about new pipes and models. We've been out in the market talking about total cost of care for several years, which has really resonated with the market. Clients have been interested in how we an guarantee that. So, we've had models in the market for about two years of total cost of care guarantees. So if they work with us around medical behavioral pharma, around what additional value we can deliver. Another model we've been in the market with is also around a trend guarantee around pharmacy. And so we have a variety of models that we've been partnering with our more leading-edge clients to develop a solution and deliver that value. -- Great. Thank you for the question. Next question, please.We can go next to Gary Taylor with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about something I thought was fairly significant in the prepared comments and wanted to flesh out a little bit. But you had talked about the fully portable electronic health record soon to be released at scale. I know you've talked about that as an ambition on the Rally chassis, I believe. But my two questions would be when, and when you say at scale, what lines of business and what parts of the country are we talking about? And just the last piece, just give us a little bit on the technology. So if I roll in with my Rally EHR and my provider is on Cerner, or Epic, or Athena, how do they actually interface with this portable medical record that I'm going to be coming in with? Thank you. -- That's a great question, Gary, and thank you for it. As outlined in our November 2017 conference, we had the ambition by the end of 2019 to develop individual health records for the 50 million fully benefited members that we serve. We would use the Rally chassis, which as indicated, now has 20 million registered users, to provide individuals in a way in which they can comprehend a tool, if you will, not only outlining their individual health record, but also giving them next-best action detail. That's what I mean by when I say it's deeply personalized. It's organized around them, not based upon generic criteria. It also assesses to what extent that they've been, and how they've been served by the health system broadly, and whether or not there's been any gaps in care that have been left behind.Our ambitions are also to take that to care providers to provide them with similar information, but in a format that looks a little bit more like their EHR. So, and again, it would include next-best action as well. And so, that would be provided to the physician in the workflow of the physician's office. You might imagine what that could ultimately lead to in terms of a continuing to develop a transaction flow between the physician and us and the consumer and us, as we us being the custodian to try to drive better health outcomes for people, but also ensure that the highest level of quality is adhered to. Quality as defined by evidence-based practices. And then also containing costs. Eventually to incent the health system about responding to those deeply personal circumstances and situations.So, we believe it to be pretty transformative across our business. It's something that we'll update you again here this coming November at our investor conference. We look forward to doing so. Thank you for the question. Next question, please.Our next question is from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Just looking at your performance. It really is quite strong in a number of areas. It makes you wonder when you look at the not-for-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, their performance seems to have improved as well. One of the few places where you have some weakness is where they're the biggest competitor. That's in terms of the national account business. Do you think that's a sign that the health insurance cycle is starting to turn over at this point? Or is the health insurance cycle dead at this point? -- I don't know that I'd be willing to make any specific projections on the cycle overall. All I can say is that our business, in a very multi-dimensional way, both on healthcare benefits and services is seeking to compete on multiple fronts, really driving or accessing the strengths of the organization around its ability to take information and apply technology and then in local markets, organization a clinical delivery system to drive better outcomes, lower total cost of care, and greater consumer satisfaction. You see that measured pretty consistently across the board of our organization. My only regret sometimes is whether or not we can do that faster and to have an even greater impact. That is what our deep intention is.I do think that our momentum around our competitiveness continues to accelerate. As a result, I think you continue to see the broad-based results that are indicated in this release, and also in the ambitions that we have for 2019 and beyond. It takes a lot of thought to make a commitment around a 13% to 16% long-term growth rate, and to step out in 2019 the way that we have. We're highly confident. This is a highly engaged management team. They are confident in their abilities to deliver those kinds of results consistently. Our aim is to do so, both to serve society, as well as each and every one of our shareholders.So, thank you for the question. We'll take one more question and then we'll be done.We'll take that question from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. -- Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to follow up on your commentary about trending '19, then pivoting to growth and self-funded in 2020. Any thoughts on the recent news flow about employers going direct to providers doing their own member engagement and so on? Is there anything you're doing to improve NPS scores there? What's driving the possible growth in 2020? -- Ana, that's a good question. Our NPS scores with large employers are very strong. They continue to advance nicely year-over-year as well. As it relates to specific arrangements that employers may want to pursue in individual markets, we of course enable that. We're not biased by any particular format. They're our customers. We aim to serve their needs. We do assist in enabling that, as well as a number of other features that may exist in their benefit design and service composition. So, we're an adaptable company. Our goal is to serve; serve people, serve consumers, and also serve health systems broadly. I think that shows up in some of the most prolific ways in the large employer market. Thank you for your question.If I can then, I will close our comments today. UnitedHealth Group, Optum, and UnitedHealthcare are driven by a single mission that we are actively and persistently engaged in helping to transform healthcare to make higher quality care accessible to more people, more simply and affordably in the U.S. and worldwide. We expect to continue to build on this year's strong momentum through the end of 2018, into 2019, and well beyond. But we never take our forward advance for granted. Every day, the people of this enterprise are committed to serving individuals and local communities. One person, one system at a time with true compassion, high quality, and innovative performance. We look forward to sharing much more with you during our annual investor conference on November 27th. Thank you for joining us this morning. This concludes our call.This will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- --  --  --  --  --  --   --  --  --  --  --  --  -- "
"Why Adobe, SendGrid, and Noodles & Co. Jumped Today","
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 4:30PM
            
            ","Tuesday gave investors an explosive move to the upside, with major benchmarks generally climbing between 2% and 3%. The Tuesday gave investors an explosive move to the upside, with major benchmarks generally climbing between 2% and 3%. The  was up more than 500 points at times during the session, and market participants generally attributed the bullish attitude to favorable numbers from third-quarter earnings and the broader macroeconomic environment. A report on job vacancies showed record levels of available work, and strong earnings from several key stocks in the healthcare field helped the market regain more of the ground it lost last week. Good news wasn't confined to healthcare, though, as , , and  were among the best performers on the day. Here's why they did so well.Shares of Adobe climbed 9.5% after the software specialist provided preliminary guidance for its 2019 fiscal year. The company expects that overall revenue growth should come in around 20% compared to fiscal 2018, with similar growth rates for its key digital media and digital experience business segments. Subscription bookings should rise at an even faster 25% rate, and Adobe expects to bring in about $1.4 billion in new net recurring revenue for the year. With the company poised to make key acquisitions, including , Adobe is doing its best to cash in on the huge interest in facilitating its customers' moves to embrace technological innovations like cloud computing.SendGrid stock soared 18% in the wake of the company receiving a buyout offer. The provider of email application programming interfaces found itself the target of cloud communications specialist , which made an  in total. Under the terms of the deal, SendGrid shareholders will get 0.485 shares of Twilio stock for every SendGrid share they own, with that price representing about a 20% premium to where SendGrid closed Monday. Twilio shares lost ground after the announcement on concerns that it might have overpaid for the purchase, but SendGrid investors seem quite happy with the opportunity to join forces with a fellow potential leader in this fast-growing space.Finally, shares of Noodles & Co. gained 16%. The restaurant chain got an upgrade from analysts at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who boosted their take on the stock from hold to buy and increased their price target by $4 to $15 per share. Noodles recently launched a low-calorie zucchini-based noodle dubbed ""zoodles"" as an alternative to traditional pasta, and SunTrust found that customers have seen zoodles as a potentially healthier choice, driving greater sales.

The stock market soared on Tuesday, climbing on momentum from positive earnings reports and favorable readings on the U.S. job market. Major benchmarks were up roughly 2% to 3%, and many investors took heart in how quickly stock indexes were able to bounce back from the severe drop they saw over a two-day period last week. Yet even with good news helping stocks across the market, there were a few companies that found themselves left out of the rally. , , and  were among the worst performers on the day. Here's why they did so poorly.Shares of Domino's Pizza declined 5% after . The popular pizza chain announced solid growth in retail sales that helped earnings per share soar by more than 65% from the year-ago period. However, investors weren't satisfied with Domino's same-store sales growth numbers, which included gains of just 3.3% internationally and 4.9% at company-owned locations domestically. For a company that's routinely put up double-digit-percentage gains in comparable sales figures, the realization that Domino's period of hyper-growth is coming to an end seemed to chill investor sentiment despite the impressive bottom-line growth that the pizza chain produced.Innophos Holdings fell nearly 17% in the wake of the issuance of its preliminary third-quarter results and new full-year guidance. The specialty ingredient company said it now expects 2018 growth to come in between 10% and 12%, down from its previous 12% to 14% range due to weaker sales in the second half of the year. Innophos made a strategic decision to discontinue some of its low-margin operations in order to concentrate on more lucrative parts of its business, and that will be responsible for much of the top-line contraction. , and they've forced Innophos to increase the prices it charges its customers as well. Although Innophos has confidence in its long-term strategic moves, investors aren't happy with the short-term impacts of the decisions it's made recently.Finally, shares of W.W. Grainger finished lower by 12%. The supplier of maintenance, repair, and operating products said that its  from the previous year's period, with adjusted earnings jumping 44% due to better margin figures and lower taxes. Yet despite the strong performance, investors seem to be uncertain about whether the company's rising sales from large and medium-sized customers will be able to continue indefinitely into the future. As long as Grainger can keep its overall expenses under control without jeopardizing its sales, today's decline seems like an overreaction to concerns that might very well never materialize."

            ","    Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call, Good morning, and welcome to the First Horizon National Corp's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Aarti Bowman of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, Cole. Please note that the earnings release, financial supplement and slide presentation we'll use in this call are posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.firsthorizon.com.In this call, we will mention forward-looking and non-GAAP information. Actual results may differ from the forward-looking information for a number of reasons outlined in our earnings materials and our most recent annual and quarterly report. Our forward-looking statements reflect our views today, and we are not obligated to update them. The non-GAAP information is identified as such in our earnings materials and in the slide presentation for this call and has reconciled the GAAP information in those material.Also please remember that this webcast on our website is the only authorized record of this call. This morning's speakers include our CEO Bryan Jordan, and our CFO, BJ Losch. Additionally, our Chief Credit Officer, Susan Springfield will be available with Bryan and BJ for questions.I'll now turn it over to Bryan. -- Thank you, Aarti. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased with our third quarter results. We're delivering strong returns and improved efficiency. We demonstrated positive operating leverage with solid earnings, continued cost saves and excellent credit trends. We showed growth in our specialty areas and in our new markets and we effectively deployed capital.Our returns continue to be strong, adjusted ROTCE was about 18% and adjusted ROA was at 1.21%. We're on track with our merger-related cost saves and our adjusted efficiency ratio was at 64% in the third quarter of 2018 and we expect it to continue to trend down as we realize additional efficiencies. We strengthened our capital ratios with the sale of our Visa B Shares, our tangible book value per share increased from net income as well as from the gain on the sale of the Visa Shares to $8.58.Loan and deposit growth were steady. We had good pipelines and we're expecting continued commitments to fund up over the remainder of the year. It's important to note, in our slides you'll see that we did some repositioning in the balance sheet and reduced outstanding low spread, low value, single product relationships by over $350 million in the quarter. We're seeing good momentum from our specialty areas and I'm encouraged by the trends in our new markets and in the Mid-Atlantic -- the new market in the mid-Atlantic and South Florida. We're focused on capitalizing on the organic growth opportunities in our new markets that has strong economies and attractive demographics, we see very good opportunities there. We do have a good platform to serve our customers as differentiated and we think we can continue to build our specialty areas on a broader basis.With that, I'll turn it over to BJ and let him walk you through the quarter and then I'll have some closing comments before we open up for questions. -- Great. Thanks Bryan. Good morning everybody. I'll start on Slide 5, with our financial results. In the third quarter, our reported EPS was at $0.83, which included our previously announced Visa sale gain. Excluding that gain and the acquisition related expenses, adjusted EPS was at $0.36. Third quarter reflected solid performance with adjusted pre-tax income driven by positive operating leverage with adjusted revenues up 1% and adjusted expenses down 1%.On the revenue side NII declined around 5 million linked quarter, driven primarily by two factors that totaled about 7 million. Number one, lower loan accretion quarter to quarter, which was about 4 million as a change and about 3 million of impact from the Auto Loan Sale we announced in the second quarter. This was offset by a gain that we had on the sale of some trust preferred loans as well as higher fixed-income revenue. Fixed income ADR was up about 75,000 a day from second and third quarter to 544,000. The expense decline was driven by continued incremental realization of merger cost saves, we did however make some incremental marketing related investments in the quarter, which we expect will help generate momentum heading into the fourth quarter and 2019.Turning to Slide 6. As we previously announced, in early September we sold our remaining Visa B Shares in the quarter for an after-tax gain of 161 million, which was a positive $0.49 impact to both EPS and tangible book value per share. And as you can see on the slide, this gain along with our earnings growth in the quarter meaningfully increased our tangible book value per share and our capital ratios. Linked quarter, tangible book value per share was 8% higher than in the second quarter up $0.64 to $8.58 with $0.49 from the Visa B gain and an additional net increase of $0.15 from retained earnings. TCE to TA increased 58 basis points to 7.12 and our CET1 ratio rose almost 90 basis points to about 9.9%.Turning to net interest income and net interest margin trends on Slide 7. You see the linked quarter ins and outs with NII and NIM down mostly from lower accretion in the third quarter and the expected impact of the 2Q '18 sale of the sub prime auto portfolio. On the liability side, although total deposit costs were up from 2Q to 3Q, as deposit competition continues to be high, we did see a moderation in our deposit cost increase as expected. Our cumulative deposit beta since the start of rate hikes in 3Q '15 is at 36%. For that same time period loan betas were at 66%, far outpacing the deposit beta movement.As we have discussed before, we are continually managing our balance sheet in totality with an intentional focus on optimizing the mix and growth of our loan and deposit portfolios over time, along with appropriately pricing our loans and deposits to deepen relationships and improve the performance of our margin. To that end, we will continue to press our advantage in our attractive specialty lending businesses, deepen our deposit customer relationships and take advantage of the floating rate nature of our loan portfolio to maintain and improve our margin over time.Taking a look at loan growth dynamics on Slide 8, we see that our specialty banking areas continue to demonstrate strong growth with linked quarter annualized growth across those aggregate businesses of about 12%. Loans to mortgage companies were up 11% linked quarter and although industry mortgage origination volumes are down, we've been able to grow the business by increasing market share. As usual, we expect fourth quarter to be down from the seasonally strong home purchasing months of the summer and fall, but believe we have opportunity of further increased market share gains over time.Asset based lending was up 3% linked quarter, primarily driven by existing customer expansion of line utilization. In our growth markets we're seeing ongoing success with our strategic efforts in Middle Tennessee, where we posted 2% loan growth linked quarter. As you know, we're continually focused on maximizing the economic profitability of our businesses and while the regional bank has seen some net growth over the course of the year in the range of 3% to 4% annualized from a loan perspective, it has come while we've been optimizing the balance sheet by exiting lower spread relationships as Bryan mentioned.Over the course of this year, we've reduced our low spread loan balances by about 360 million. This has cut our regional bank loan growth by roughly half of what it could have been. This is the right thing for the balance sheet long term and has improved loan yields by 73 basis point in those portfolios alone. Over time replacing these loans will have a nice impact on our overall yields and free up balance sheet for higher return lending.As you can see on Slide 9, credit trends remain excellent, net charge-offs were at 2 million in the third quarter, flat from the second quarter, provision was also at 2 million and the allowance to loans remained steady at 68 basis points. Turning to slide 10, I'll quickly give an update on the Capital Bank merger. Our cost savings remain on track with 16 million of cost saves achieved as expected in the third quarter and that means about 75% of the costs are now in the run rate and should be substantially in the run rate fully by the end of this year.Revenue synergies increased again with 31 million of annualized year-to-date deals closed or in process. And as Bryan and I both mentioned, we've started to see some promising signs of growth from our newer markets in the Carolinas, what we call Mid-Atlantic and South Florida. Our retail deposits in those markets were up 5% and 3% linked quarter respectively. And as we've discussed before, now that our merger integration activities are behind us, we're confident in our ability to profitably grow both loan and deposit relationships in these markets and we expect those positive trends to continue.Wrapping up on slide 11. We're very pleased with where we sit with our return profile and that profile that we've built for sustainable returns going forward. With a return on tangible common equity at almost 18%, our return on equity at 10.7% and a return on assets at 1.21%. With these results, we're already right at or exceeding our medium term return targets we laid out in May and continue our improvement toward our efficiency ratio goal of 60% or below, which will drive continued improvement in our returns to shareholders.So with that, I'll turn it back over to Bryan. -- Thank you BJ. In summary, I am really pleased with the third quarter results and excited about the opportunities that we have ahead of us. We are optimistic about the fourth quarter in 2019 and feel very good about our ability to continue to drive strong returns in the business. The economy continues to be stable, customer sentiment continues to be good, loan pipelines have strengthened into the fourth quarter. So we're optimistic as we look into the remainder of this year and into 2019. Word of thanks to all of our employees for all of their hard work, not only ramping up the integration late in the second quarter and into the third quarter, but also the hard work to serve our customers and appreciate that.As a reminder, we're holding our Investor Day on November the 6th in Nashville. We'll be providing more information about not only our strategy, but our execution planned with our Executive Team in attendance. If you need details please reach out to us directly. With that Cole, we'll now open it up for any questions.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good morning everybody. -- Hi, Steve. -- Hi, Steve. -- I want to start on the deposit side. I am looking at the increase in deposit costs, I was surprised to see the degree of increase in the commercial interests, which were up 25 bps quarter-over-quarter. Can you give some color on why we saw such a big increase there? Was it all related to the prior increase you had done in larger account balances? -- Hey, Steve. Good morning, it's BJ. I think on the commercial deposit side, the competition has really since the beginning of the cycle been much more heated than the consumer deposit side. So there's not really a material change in what the competition looks like there. There is high competition both on the earnings credit rates as well as the business interest-bearing account. So there wasn't anything that was out of the ordinary in the quarter, it's just continued increased competition. -- And then BJ, you guys are calling out pretty good growth in Florida and the Carolinas on the deposit side. Give some perspective what types of deposits are you raising and what's the cost of those in those markets? -- Yeah, so it's our normal mix. We're getting, obviously we're leaning in those market to establish ourselves a little bit more strongly coming out of the integration. And we've gone out as you might expect with the money market and CD offers that we thought were attractive, but then it's also bringing in core checking account relationships as well. And I would tell you that the deposit betas that we saw in the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas in terms of those retail deposits are actually in line with what we saw across the rest of the footprint and then in Tennessee.So in aggregate, our portfolio mix isn't materially different than what we're seeing elsewhere, nor are our betas which is highly encouraging to us. So we expect to be able to continue to drive positive momentum and deposit growth in those markets. We're putting some of that marketing related investments that I mentioned earlier, to work in those markets to again establish a foothold, establish a brand and grow core deposits over time. And as we've talked about previously what we'd love to see is those markets further establish with meaningful deposit growth there over time such that we could replace our market index deposits from a funding perspective and continue to enhance relationships and improve our margin. -- Okay, that's helpful. And how are you thinking about the core margin here in 4Q? -- I would characterize my view as stable going into the fourth quarter. I'd say that the margin was largely in line with what we would have thought and maybe a hair less than what we would have thought. And so, I see it as relatively stable.And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. -- Good morning, guys. -- Hi, Ebrahim. -- I guess just first question around capital management strategy, I'm not sure if BJ or Bryan who wants to take it, but I get -- I think you recently again reiterated your focus on the 8% to 9% CET1, we've got a bump from the Visa gain, as you mentioned earlier. I am just trying to understand your appetite to buyback stock, given that it felt like a quarter ago in July, you felt the stock was cheap, we're down about 10% to 15% since then. And I'm just trying to gauge the Management's urgency in being able to deploy about $230 million in remaining buyback authorization. -- Hey, Ebrahim, this is Bryan. I'll start and if BJ wants to add I don't know. We do think that there will be opportunities and now maybe one of those to be opportunistic in repurchased stock. We monetized the Visa gain, we bolstered the capital ratios, we had a ascent from a lot of feedback that we were screening low on a book -- price to book as well as how price to book and low on tangible capital to total asset ratios. And that created a bump with the hidden capital that we knew that was there. But as we look into the future, we think our capital ratios are sufficient.We have given a great deal of information about our stress testing, we published it in the third quarter. So you've got that out there. And we think that with priorities for loan growth, organic growth being number one, our managing capital is probably our number two priority as we look into the remainder this year and into 2019. So we do think that there will be attractive opportunities to buy stock and we do have the authorization to do it and we fully intend to use it as appropriate. -- Got it -- go ahead. -- I would add Ebrahim, I mean, if you look at where our return profile is and we're confident that we can continue to maintain and improve that into 2019. And then you juxtapose that with what our forward earnings look like, what our price to book, what our price tangible book looks like and we're very bullish on where we're taking the Company and this could very well be a great opportune time to buy back some of our shares. -- So, is it fair to assume that we still think the 8% to 9% CET1 is where we are targeting capital ratios or is the TCE's 7% also something that you're going to triangulate too when thinking about capital management? -- Ebrahim, this is Bryan. We still -- we primarily focus on the CET1 ratio the 8% to 9% is what's in the bonefish. The reason we focus on that is our balance sheets are not created equally and a 7% ratio is an even more blunt instrument, and when you look at the risk weighting of our assets, particularly the $2.5 billion to $2.5 billion of average assets associated with our fixed income business there is very, very little risk in that and it shouldn't and it doesn't draw very much capital. So we manage more around CET1, we think that's a good framework, we think that's adequate capital and we'll use those ratios to manage our capital allocation going forward.And our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. -- Hey, John. -- First on the credit quality side, I noticed you flagged the credit that moved onto non-performers in the quarter that contributed to the -- looks like $20 million increase in NPAs. How -- can you give us a little bit of color on that or what that -- what was the size of the credit, what's the industry? Did you put aside any incremental reserves against it or take any charge-offs? Thanks. -- Hi, John, it's Susan. Yes, it was a $24 million credit in the financial services industry. We did previously been a classified credit, I believe it was in the non-performing in the third quarter. And we've not taken any charge-offs that we have reserved some against it. -- Okay. And you said it was financial services credit. -- Yes. -- Okay. All right. And then on that topic, any incremental -- any indicative, there's any incremental inflows you expect on that front? -- No actually that one is really an isolated incident. I'm really pleased with what I am saying as it relates to asset quality kind of the PD, average PD grade actually improved quarter-over-quarter, which is our probability default grade rating for our commercial portfolio. So we're continuing to see strong asset quality and that was just an isolated downgrade. -- Okay, thank you. And then separately on the margin, I know you gave us some expectation for relatively stable for the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about it in terms of a general trajectory through our -- for 2019. I know it's a little bit further off, and you're going to probably talk about it at your Investor Day, but, I mean, how should we think about it, I mean, are we going to see some incremental expansion as we get some additional moves by the Fed or are we still looking at relatively stable as we move through '19? -- Hey, John it's BJ. Yeah, we'll talk a little bit more about it at Investor Day as well. But we are continually trying to position our balance sheet to improve the margin over time. If you start with our continued asset sensitivity and our outlook for Fed increases, we would think there is probably one late this year and at least one more next year. And with our asset sensitive balance sheet that provides a tailwind, number one.Number two, our loans to mortgage company business continues to perform well. So even though industry mortgage originations are starting to moderate as the long end, the curve is moving higher, we think their ability to take market share is going to provide us tailwind as well. And so, we expect that to continue.Number three, we are very, very focused in our banking business on DDA growth. It's DDA growth in consumer and it's DDA growth in our commercial businesses, including our specialty businesses, and we have confidence in our execution plans to be able to do that. And as you well know, our ability to drive DDA is our most profitable way to improve the funding side of our balance sheet. And so, we're going to be very, very intently focused on that. And those three things we think will help continue to support the margin.And the last will be, as our loan growth continues into 2019 based on what we're seeing on the balance sheet and how disciplined we are, we think that that can continue to help us incrementally improve the margin as we've taken out these lower spread relationship loans as well. So we've got several levers that over time we think that we can continue to help improve the margin.And the next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please go ahead. -- Yeah, thanks, good morning guys. -- Good morning. -- Wanted to touch on the loan growth outlook, how you guys, how are pipelines here at the end of the quarter and then specifically the 360 million of run-off year-to-date, is that still -- have you worked through most of that or is that still a headwind that we're going to have to digest in coming quarters? -- Yeah, well, I'll start with the run-off that we had, there were a couple of different areas of the business and it wasn't by the way to be clear, simply Capital Bank related portfolios that we were repositioning, it was also First Tennessee related portfolios, in aggregate, we were repositioning our balance sheet to be able to take advantage of other things that we saw, but it was loan portfolios that had yields in the 2% to low 3% ranges at the beginning of the year, which we just felt like were not accretive to us and as Bryan said, really single product relationships that we didn't have an opportunity to deepen. So we took the opportunity to take those out and move ahead.We're always optimizing our balance sheet like this, but I would tell you that, in terms of the magnitude of the repositioning that we've done over the first three quarters, that magnitude of change will not continue to occur. We've largely repositioned most of what we wanted to do with some of the larger buckets. And so, going forward, it would not be nearly as visible. -- Then on the pipeline and production side, we've actually seen significant increase in production in the specialty businesses, core commercial, commercial real estate of about 13% quarter-over-quarter, so third quarter production was strong. And that's even excluding mortgage warehouse. If you include mortgage warehouse, our production quarter-over-quarter was up about, production was up about 30%. So we feel well positioned as we go into the fourth quarter and in the pipeline really across multiple areas including the Capital Bank market, the Carolinas and Florida, many of the specialty businesses are reporting strong pipelines for fourth quarter. -- Casey, this is Bryan. September was our strongest month of the year in terms of production and Susan said, very good pipeline going into the fourth quarter. I wouldn't characterize personally the repositioning of the portfolio as a headwind. As BJ noted in his opening comments, our margins on those -- on that business that we replaced it with are 73 basis points higher. I think it's important to note, when you look at our balance sheet that we're not driving just the cosmetic, so the size of the balance sheet, we're driving the profitability of the balance sheet and return on the capital that we have deployed in it. So while it may be, what appears to a headline to top line loan growth, in terms of profitability it's the right decision to position the balance sheet from a more profitable relationship oriented perspective. So, I just want to fine-tune, I wouldn't characterize it as a headwind. -- And then one additional point about optimizing when you exit kind of single product relationship. And we've looked at this over time, asset quality performs better with customers where you have deeper relationships, we have insight into Treasury Management cash flow et cetera. So in addition to improved margins, we also believe that over time that improves assets somewhat. -- Okay, understood. I guess, in keeping with the profitability, BJ, I'm following up on your comments on perhaps optimizing the market index funding side. Is that something that you guys are actively prioritizing higher and is there a loan to deposit ratio at 91% or so is OK. How -- what's the appetite to take that higher to paydowns, to optimize the higher cost market index deposit? -- Yeah, so it's obviously a high priority for us as we talked about the last couple of quarters, we would like to replace as much as that market index over time as we possibly can. It's going to take a while right, because we've got to build our portfolios and particularly in the newer markets to be able to replace it. But personally, I would love to see deposit growth outpace loan growth, because I think that we would improve our margins and our net interest income by doing that. But we're comfortable with a 90%-ish loan to deposit ratio that doesn't make it uncomfortable, nor would something a couple of basis points higher if we saw good profitable loan growth. So you'll probably hear more from us on Investor Day around that topic, but we continue to focus very intently on trying to optimize our funding mix and that's one way to do it.And our next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Great, thanks, good morning. -- Good morning. -- I guess maybe starting off with the loan growth if we could. It's -- I guess Slide 8, it looks the idea, you do certainly have pockets where you're seeing some strong growth, but I guess average loans in total of 0.2% -- again, I understand that the run-off portfolio we were talking about earlier, like what is the biggest headwind to growth at this point. And also kind of as you look out over the next year, like, does that accelerate? Like what drives that meaningfully higher than where it is today? Thanks. -- Ken, this is Bryan, I'll start. I don't see anything that is particularly a headwind to loan growth. We have very good calling activities, we see very good strength across all of our markets and in some ways optimism or pipelines picked up in some of these markets late in the quarter. That said, we are thoughtful about what we put on the balance sheet, the risk and reward that we take when we enter into a relationship, there are pockets where structure and pricing have gotten to points that we decided that we can't be competitive at those levels. And so, you might characterize that as a headwind.I'd characterize that as just managing the balance sheet for one, you're going to like long term. And so, I don't see anything that is particularly a problematic area out there. I just think we're trying to be smart about the business we book, we're managing it for profitability, we're using the balance sheet to support relationships and as we looked into the fourth quarter and we look into 2019, we think, something in that mid-single digit area is still a reasonable way to think about the growth potential of our balance sheet. -- Got you. Okay, that helps. And then just a question back on the NIM being stable next quarter, what underlying assumptions you're making about the accretion income as part of that. And should we expect accretion income to continue to decline from here or is it just going to remain volatile given sort of accelerated payoffs? -- Hey, Ken, it's BJ. I think we -- our loan accretion in any given quarter probably peaked in the second quarter where we had 18 million, this quarter we had 14 million. I would expect that it continues to step down by a couple, $2 million, $3 million a quarter over the next several quarters. And so, that would certainly be a headwind to the margin.And our next question comes from Brady Gailey from KBW. Please go ahead. -- Hey, good morning guys. -- Good morning, Brady. -- So if you look at the efficiency ratio, you saw some improvement down to 64%. I know that you have kind of the longer-term goal of sub 60%. You still have some cost saves coming from CBF in the fourth quarter this year and then into next year. Do you think that you can get the efficiency ratio at that 60% or better level as you exit 2019? -- That's our goal. That's what we're driving for. And again, it will be a combination of overall positive operating leverage with Bryan and Susan both talked about some of the momentum we've got, we believe going into the fourth quarter. I talked a little bit about what we're trying to do to drive profitability out of the funding side of the balance sheet. We're continuing to take cost out of the organization from the merger saves and we'll be very disciplined as we have been about what we spend money on going into 2019 such that we're continuing to improve that efficiency ratio. As you've seen over the last five, six quarters, we've improved it by 700 basis points or more. And that's clearly one of our main priorities is to continue to improve the profit margin of the Company. -- All right. And then on the M&A side, CBF has been closed for a few quarters now, you've got almost all the cost saves realized a little more to come. But, Bryan are you ready to start thinking about another potential acquisition? -- Brady, this is Bryan. Short answer is no. We're focused on execution on organic opportunities. We think that we have tremendous opportunities and momentum and the footprint that we have and we want to capitalize that and continue to build our business model and focus on those markets. So in short, no. -- Got it. Thanks guys.And our next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. -- Good morning. -- I guess just following up on the loan transition comments from earlier. How are the markets, the new CBF markets transitioning? Are they on track with what you wanted to in terms of moving away from CRE and into the C&I side and should we expect to see the pipeline in those markets increasing? -- Yes, Jared, we are seeing very good shifts in terms of additional focus on core C&I. From the existing teams that we have that are very strong, in addition, we're recruiting new bankers in both Carolinas and South Florida who is focused on C&I core commercial relationship building. And as we mentioned earlier, the pipelines in the Carolinas and in South Florida are strong going into the fourth quarter. And we had particularly good production Mid-Atlantic, which is our Carolinas Capital Bank market in the third quarter. So we're pleased with where we are and the opportunities in those markets that are dynamic and vibrant and growing. We're also pleased with our ability to attract strong bankers from many different institutions that have potential clients that they could bring over over time. -- Great. Thanks. And then on the fixed income business, it was good to see the growth in the ADRs there. How did that playout sort of within the quarter and as we saw the 10-year start moving at the end of the quarter, was that -- did that ramp up moving through the quarter and is that sustaining itself so far through fourth quarter? -- It bounced around throughout the quarter, third quarter in the fixed income business is in any year volatile just because of the month of August and everything that's happening around holidays and vacations, it bounced around, activity was a little better probably on average in September. But it was up and down throughout and we're seeing the same trends continue a little bit here and even into the start of the fourth quarter. -- Great. Thank you.And our next question comes from Rob Placet from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Hi. good morning. -- Good morning. -- Middle Tennessee, Nashville is a market you've seen good growth in over the last number of years. I was just curious if you could talk about the success you've had there and how translatable that is, that strategy is in your new markets in Carolinas then any differences in strategy say in Nashville versus the Carolinas? -- Yeah, this is Bryan. I think that's an important point and we articulate optimism about the opportunities in Mid-Atlantic and South Florida, for example. We firmly believe that the model that's been executed in Middle Tennessee over the last handful of years is a really good example of how we're going to continue to grow and to gain share in those markets Mid-Atlantic, South Florida in addition to the demographic similarities. It is a model that we know works, it's proven and we fully intend to deploy it. So the lessons that we used to grow in Middle Tennessee are going to be the same things that we're going to deploy in the growth markets in mid-Atlantic and South Florida and it does give us that optimism. -- Okay, thanks. -- One final point on that, which is that would be one of the topics that we talk about in the Investor Day. So I'll tease the Investor Day a little bit.And our next question comes from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- Thanks, good morning. -- Hi Jon. -- A question on the synergies, you called out 31 million in annualized revenue and 471 deals closed or in process. Can you maybe give us an example of what one of those deals might be, one or two of those deals might be. And then, curious, how much more potential you see? -- We have several different types of synergy opportunities Jon. Let me give you a couple of different ones that we're already executing on and we believe there are more out there. For existing clients either in legacy First Tennessee or Capital Bank in terms of whole limits and where we like to be, obviously it's a bigger balance sheet when there are opportunities to take on additional exposure on the lending side, it gives us that opportunity to do that without going over limits. That's one example.The opportunity to broaden relationships and we touched on this earlier about how important it is from a return standpoint, that even performance, the opportunity to offer treasury management products to clients. So as an example I know there is opportunity with a lock box for an existing customer in the Capital Bank franchise, and we had other products that we didn't have that an opportunity to expand there. And then the third one I would bring up and all these are opportunities within synergies would be the opportunity to private client banking where we offer wealth management and private client lending to customers, executives and owners of businesses.And then last but not least would be our specialty lending verticals that we've had in the core First Tennessee franchise for a while, the opportunity we're seeing referrals into those specialty businesses from our bankers in the Carolinas and Florida. So, asset-based lending, franchise finance, mortgage warehouse lending so we're seeing opportunities for referrals as well. -- Okay, good. And more to come -- you expect more to come from these opportunities? -- Jon, this is Bryan. I think we've just scratched the tip of the iceberg here. I think we have a tremendous amount of opportunity as Susan articulated across a broad number of fronts, whether it be treasury management, and P card(ph)to expanded balance sheet and referrals to specialty businesses. You take the ABL business for example, Capital Bank's credit profile was much like ours, the ABL capabilities and the tools we have there will give us greater opportunities to call in these markets and expand our growth opportunities. So we think there are quite a few opportunities left and we will continue to build on them. -- Okay. And then a quick one for BJ. I don't know if you mentioned this, I may have missed it, but the reduction of low spread loan balances for the quarter, was that about a $200 million headwind, I'm just looking back through some of my notes. Is that about right for the quarter? -- No, no, it was 360 million in total year-to-date. I would say that it was probably a little less than 100 million for those low-spread, low value and then, remember we sold the sub-prime auto which was about $100 million. So, in aggregate those were a couple of hundred million in the quarter. -- Yeah. Good, thank you. -- Sure. -- Nice Jon.And our next question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead. -- Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow up on the specialty blended growth. Susan, you mentioned some of the areas. Can you kind of size some of those opportunities for us where you stand in the build out some of those different businesses and maybe where you're looking to hire both in those businesses in the core franchise there is a bank in Nashville that obviously put out a lot of press releases here about hires. Just wanted to get the outlook for you guys. Thanks. -- Yeah, so I'll start, it's BJ. So, really our most profitable lending businesses are loans to mortgage company business. And we continue to look for ways to expand that. That's one of our top priorities. But across asset based lending loans to mortgage companies, franchise finance business in particular, those businesses in aggregate have less than 5% national market share. And so, we have huge opportunity over time to continue to build out teams, different specific sub niches within those lines of business and we're very optimistic that we can -- that we can do that and as we've talked about before, the reason that we like those businesses is that we, we see higher risk adjusted returns on those, they have excellent efficiency ratios within those businesses, there's fewer more focused competitors in those areas because you have to know how to lend to those specific clients, so not all banks can do it.And so, we see a little bit more rationality that we might see in some other lending areas. So all of that really pushes us toward trying to allocate more resources to that growth. And if you look over the last five years, our specialty lending businesses have grown a 150% in terms of balance sheet growth over $6 billion. And that's excellent growth and it's been growth that's been very profitable. And we expect that we will continue to grow those types of business double digits and make more prof -- make the left side of the balance sheet even more profitable. -- That's great color. Maybe just following up on that excluding the run-off of the non-strategic. You guys still think that the core bank that mid single-digit growth rate is kind of in the cards as we think about next year? -- Yeah, we certainly think so. So, some of the repositioning of the balance sheet that we talked about this year has needed some of that growth. I think if you look at the regional bank itself, I think we're seeing maybe 3% to 4% annualized growth, but that's -- that was roughly cut in half by some of the repositioning of portfolios. And so, going into next year total balance sheet growth in the mid-single digits is very reasonable for what we say. -- That's helpful. And maybe just one final one for me. Still couple of quarters out, but any initial thoughts on the impact to seasonal(ph)for you guys? Thanks. -- Yes, it's, number one, a very frustrating thing and if any of you are knowledgeable on why we would want to change this and had told to FASB that I'd love to hear it because I think it can be very disruptive. But nevertheless, we will be prepared for it going in. If we don't have any specific impacts to share with you in terms of the magnitude of the change in our day one reserves or what it will look like on our P&L, but we are in line to slightly ahead with our planning of being prepared for seasonal, but hopefully something does change in and dialog does continue to happen such that we can maybe land it in a more helpful place for both investors and banks before it's actually implemented. -- Michael, this is Bryan. I would add to what BJ said, I strongly agree with the comments I read that Jamie Dimon made last week I think that, that it will be pro-cyclical, I think this is an accounting convention that will be pro-cyclical. I don't think it's going to be particularly helpful to understanding financial statements. And to sort of reiterate BJ's point of a minute or so ago, to the extent that investors have strong views on the validity of whether this makes sense or not, you need to express it to the accounting standard riders. I keep saying when we talk to investors are demanding this, and it doesn't. I can't find that groundswell of support. I just think it's not good for the economy, I don't think it's good for customers long term. And I think ultimately it's not going to give investors any better understanding of financial statements.And the next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First just a little clarification, when you were talking about the NIM staying stable in the fourth quarter that was the core NIM, right. Just wanted to clarify on that? -- That's right. -- Thank you. So just in terms of asset sensitivity, you kind of mentioned that a few times as a positive on the conference call, but I guess given the discussion about the stable core NIM into year-end and given that Slide 7 shows a negative impact from rate stays and other in the slide deck, can you kind of help us by quantifying that asset sensitivity that used to be a useful chart in the slide deck, but it seems to be gone the last couple of quarters. Just how much of a benefit is there still from rising rates? -- Aarti is sitting here pointing and laughing at me because I told her we didn't need that anymore, now that we need it. The asset sensitivity hasn't much changed from when we had that -- had that graph in there. There's been modest mix shifts as we would have expected, particularly in the deposit portfolio as rates have started to rise, little bit more of a shift into money market and money market into CDs, which would dampen asset sensitivity. But in terms of the lending that we're continuing to do, it's predominantly floating rate, and so in aggregate, our asset sensitivity has meaningfully changed. And so, we would expect the same types of net increases that we had seen before maybe I think I'm trying to recall, I think it's maybe $8 million annualized for a 25 basis point move, something like that. It's roughly the same. -- I guess the reason for asking is, it doesn't really feel like it's been coming through the last couple of quarters. The comments on 4Q stable core NIM kind of suggests there's not much benefit there in 4Q. So again what's the piece that I'm missing there? -- Yeah, so I would tell you that the last two quarters have really -- the difference has been the deposit beta. So the deposit beta of course from 3Q '15 to the first quarter of '18 let's say was very, very low and if you actually go back, we would have beat those asset sensitivity metrics that we put out on that graph before we would have been ahead of them last couple of quarters, because we were defending our deposit base, that our deposit betas were higher, which dampened the sensitivity. But over time particularly when rates, short rates ultimately moderate and stop increasing, we think that, that again will help us in terms of our net asset sensitivity. And so, I think, Geoffrey it's a question of timing, but over time, and through a cycle we think our asset sensitivity is in tact.And our next question comes from Tyler Stafford from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning guys. -- Good morning. -- I wanted to start just on the mortgage warehouse and obviously a good quarter there and the deck talked about market share gains driving that volume. I was just wondering if you can talk about the pricing or the yields in that business today. And just curious, if you're seeing any spread degradation at all just given that market share gains? -- Yeah, so it's still our highest yielding portfolio on the commercial side. Do you have that -- -- Yeah, we the yield is 546 for the quarter. -- Yeah, so it's almost 550 in terms of yield. And so, very healthy. I would generally say though that, as we've continued to build market share, of course, there are certain instances where we gleaned in and gotten little bit more aggressive than the portfolio yield to try to acquire balances, but that rate volume trade-off has been a net positive for us, of course. And so, we would expect that type of momentum to continue, we'll always look to increase our share at a profitable rate and I will tell you that Bob Garrett and our loan to mortgage company team and business out there do a phenomenal job of managing economic profit and managing returns on individual relationships such that we're giving fair pricing to our clients, but also making sure that the bank gets paid for using our balance sheet as well.So we expect those yields to continue to go up, particularly as when rates do rise because they're a short-term oriented rate business. And so, we're very pleased with how it's performing. -- In addition to that, we've seen some really good deposit opportunity within the mortgage warehouse lending business, and so, calling on those customers and talking with them about deposits. And then one last thing is it relates to market share growth in mortgage warehouse, it's been a combination of an increase in client count. So, client count mortgage warehouse even just quarter-over-quarter was up about 5%, year-over-year we're up about 15% in terms of numbers of client. And then, in select cases, we're increasing some loans to existing customers. So we like the business and we like both the lending side and the deposit opportunities that are there as well. -- Very helpful. And do you have what the 546 comparable yield would have been in 2Q? -- 544. -- Okay. And then just lastly, BJ, you mentioned the stock looks attractive, based on your forward earnings profile. You guys just reported a 1.28 annualized EPS quarter, you've got 75% of the CVS(ph)cost savings now in the run rate. And at some point next year, I would imagine the headwind of normalizing higher credit costs and then some margin, GAAP margin at least headwinds from declining accretion and funding pressures. So, I'm just curious what's the biggest driver or drivers that you see internally from an earnings inflection that will be the biggest driver to an improved forward earnings trajectory that you see? -- Hey, Tyler, just to clarify $0.36 times four is $1.44. -- Yeah, I took out some of the one-time items in there, the drops and some other items. -- That doesn't drop to $0.20, but regardless, I'll stay with what we've got, which is a $0.36 run rate right now. We talked about loan growth and what we thought the outlook was for there on this call. So we feel pretty good about what we can do going into next year. We've repositioned the balance sheet for stronger profitability going forward. We still got asset sensitivity that we believe can come through, we're starting to see good deposit growth, particularly out of the newer markets, which will certainly help us in terms of our funding mix. And again overall, we are very, very focused on positive operating leverage. And those things I just said, will drive the top line while we continue to get a full year's worth of benefit next year in expenses. And sitting here today, our expectation would be that expenses would be down next year, primarily due to the cost saves while we continue to move the top line up.So, we'll be very focused on making sure that that happens going into next year. And that should obviously be helpful to expanding the earnings side. On the denominator, the EPS, as we talked about earlier, given where our valuations are, we think it's a very attractive time for us to look at share buybacks. And so, we'll be looking at both sides of that equation to continue to improve our earnings per share profile. -- Tyler, this is Bryan. I'll just add to BJ's comment, we have a lot of clarity about where our calling efforts are, we recognize and our bankers did a great job through the integration, but when you're doing the integration in the first half, first really three quarters of the year, focus goes on to the blocking and tackling in the short term and not the calling efforts and growing the business. We see that turning, we see the momentum pick up, and as we see the business unfolding in fourth quarter and 2019, we're significantly confident that we have a pretty good outlook for the remainder of this year and the turn of next year.And our next question comes from Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Please go ahead. -- Thanks, good morning. I guess just probably, following up on that question. Bryan, you touched on FTN Securities and it didn't sound like a resounding endorsement in terms of the business volume and cadence you're seeing there. You've got a bit of a long march ahead in terms of more rate hikes until you get to a more favorable tailwind for that business. And I mean, parting with that would certainly give you a leg up on efficiency ratio and other metrics, and how does that kind of fit in? -- Well, Brock, that's a business that we like and we had a slide and a deck for a presentation we made mid -- early mid September. And it shows that business is counter-cyclical. So if you look at it from our perspective one, it is a business that has done very well and returns on capital for many, many years, we're comfortable with it. And we've been in the business close to 100 years than not. And so, we understand it well. It is counter-cyclical and when credit does start to deteriorate in the industry, we will see a pickup in that and we've seen it historically we will see a pickup there, it will be a counter-cyclical offset. And in many ways I think an advantage for us in that, while credit costs are going up across the industry and ours will as well, we have an offset to that.Given that, we're not particularly panicked about the outlook for the next two or three or six quarters, we feel good about the business, we feel good about the team and what they're doing to control cost and to drive profitability in the business. And so, it's a business that we're comfortable with, we like the capital allocation, we think it's a good counter-cyclical balance and we're committed to driving it. -- Okay. And separately as a follow-up on the provisioning in the provisioning tempo, that's kind of oscillated from a small negative to small positive. When do we -- when should we, how should we think about that normalizing? -- At this point Brock, we continue to see asset quality remains excellent and we continue to have run-off in the non-strategic portfolio. So we'll see probably some opportunities to release non-strategic. We use the models and we believe that our -- we got good coverage that relates to the allowance. If the economy were to turn, credit quality started deteriorating obviously, you'd see that build at this point, I see the provision remaining rather stable across the next few quarters, based on what we know today.And our next question comes from Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners. Please go ahead. -- Thanks, good morning. Bryan, you had mentioned a while ago about the repositioning not being a headwind. So just kind of tagging onto looking at ROA and ROTCE, particularly as you have outlined on slide 11, do we get a catch-up coming soon just as a timing that sort of gets the ROA a little bit stronger than obviously as you play out 2019, to see where that can go. It just seems that you're earning in your zone on the return on tangible common, but just a little bit below and the ROA, just want to reconcile the timing of that. -- Yeah, I think you'll start to see it improving in the fourth quarter and into 2019 particularly as you realize the additional cost saves, which also affect the overhead efficiency ratio. But you should see both of those ratios continue to improve the capital, we did increase the capital buffer in the middle of this quarter. So it's starting at a higher level of capital, but from an ROA perspective, we would expect that to continue to improve into 2019. -- Okay, great. And then is it possible to compute a core loan yield, you may have mentioned that in the prior question, I just want to go back to that. -- quote-unquote loan yield, I don't have it in front of me, but -- so we can get it -- -- Short answer is, yes. -- Okay. (inaudible) -- We can do that. Refining core maybe the hard part, you just excluded non-strategic, we could probably do that fairly quickly. -- Very well guys. Thank you so much for the time. -- All right, Chris. Thank you.And our next question comes from Matthew Keating from Barclays. Please go ahead. -- Great, thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the Company's asset sensitivity please. So you know last quarter we talked about deposit betas moderating from 2Q levels in the back half of this year. As you think about deposit betas in Q4, do you think that what we saw in Q3 is a reasonable expectation. And then separately perhaps you could quantify the impact of the more muted move in LIBOR this past quarter had on loan yields? Thanks. -- Hey, Matt, it's BJ. So on the deposit, I think in terms of betas, I would venture to say that 2Q was probably our high watermark, 3Q clearly moderated. And I would hope and expect that 4Q would be flat to further moderate from 3Q levels. And so, that will be helpful of course to the core margin in the fourth quarter. What was the other question Matt? -- Thanks, BJ. And the other question would be, obviously LIBOR move was a bit muted in the third quarter. But it looks like it's picking up from here. And so, you think you will see obviously that benefit should flow through I guess as much. So the question is really like, how big of an impact I guess the more muted move have on loan yields if you're able to quantify that at all? -- Yeah, I think if you look at our reconciliation on the NIM slide, we had something I think called rate stays in others, which was about four basis point decline, I'd say a couple of basis points of that was related to LIBOR ultimately. -- Great. Thanks very much.And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bryan Jordan for any closing remarks. -- Thank you, Cole. We appreciate you taking time to join with us this morning. Again, I'll encourage you if you have not already please join us for our November the 6th Investor Day in Nashville, please reach out to Aarti and let us know. We have a lot of good information that we'll cover. We'll have our management team there going through the business and will spend more time talking about our outlook for the remainder of this year, but also for 2019 and beyond. Please feel free to reach out if you have any follow-up questions. I hope everybody has a great day. Thank you.The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by "

3 Stocks for Warren Buffett Fans,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 5:00PM
            
            ","Warren Buffett has no shortage of acolytes, and it's easy to see why.Warren Buffett has no shortage of acolytes, and it's easy to see why.The   chief and founder has made thousands of early investors in his conglomerate rich as the parent of businesses like GEICO car insurance and Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad has posted average annual returns of 20% over the last 50 years, . Buffett has never gotten too big for his britches, however. He still lives in a modest house in his hometown of Omaha, and he's full of homespun wisdom that even the most novice investor can absorb. Buffett has made a mint out of value investing and finding companies with sustainable competitive advantages, or , as he calls them. In that vein, we have three picks from fool.com contributors for Buffett fans. Keep reading to see why they think , , and  would be great choices for Buffett-style investors today.Warren Buffett isn't exactly a fan of volatile healthcare stocks. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway only holds four healthcare stocks in its entire portfolio at the moment -- , Johnson & Johnson, , and .The main reasons for Buffett's diffidence toward healthcare as an investing vehicle are the sector's intense levels of competition, rapid pace of innovation, as well as its heavy dependence on political trends that seem to change nearly every election cycle. In short, the sector's profitability is hard to predict over the long term, which generally isn't a very attractive feature for a classic fundamentals-based investor like Buffett. Healthcare giant J&J, though, has been among the few companies operating in the sector that has consistently overcome these three key headwinds -- leading to market-beating gains for its shareholders over the last 30-plus years. The company's magic, if you will, has been its industry-leading pharmaceutical pipeline that has quickly replaced drugs either going off patent or that are losing their competitive edge in the marketplace. The net result is that J&J's top line and free cash flows have both  to churn ever higher, despite severe downturns for former star products like Olysio and Remicade, among many others.In turn, J&J has been able to steadily increase its top-notch dividend program for an awe-inspiring 56 consecutive years. That's a particularly rare feat for a healthcare company -- underscoring why Buffett has felt comfortable owning this stock for almost 13 straight years at this point. Buffett fans, therefore, may want to take a deeper look at this shining gem of the healthcare sector.    Buffett hasn't always been a fan of airline stocks, stating in 2013 that they were ""a death trap for investors,"" but Berkshire has been loading up on them in recent years as margins have improved. As of June 30, Berkshire owned 56.5 million Southwest shares -- a roughly 10% stake in the airline that's worth about $3.2 billion at today's prices.The airline fits the Buffett criteria of having a strong management team and a well-liked brand, with the company ranking first among budget airlines in customer satisfaction, according to a survey by J.D. Power. Southwest also has the lowest rate of complaints filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation. Today, the company runs 96% of its flights domestically and serves just 14 international destinations, but CEO Gary Kelly anticipates that it could add  across North and South America. Southwest's highly regarded service and projections for substantial passenger growth over the next two decades suggest there would be demand to support significant expansion. Southwest has also been delivering big dividend hikes and is in a good position to keep the increases coming. The company has quadrupled its payout over the last five years, and while the stock's yield is still relatively small at roughly 1.1%, the cost of covering its forward distribution comes in at just 15% of trailing earnings and 18% of trailing free cash flow. Shares trade at roughly 14 times this year's expected earnings, a valuation that leaves room for significant upside in light of the company's international expansion potential and fast-growing dividend. Buffett began buying shares of General Motors back in 2012, shortly after the automaker was relisted after emerging from bankruptcy, and he  since. GM seems like a natural fit in Berkshire's portfolio. The company has a slew of big global brands like Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick that has brought it success at home and in far-flung markets like China, which is now the world's biggest car market. Its value seems to be overlooked as auto investors have swooned instead over names like and Uber, but GM continues to spin off mountains of cash. The stock now trades at a P/E of just 5.2, which may be partly explained by the American auto cycle's having passed its peak, but it still seems excessively cheap given the strength of the underlying business. GM also offers a dividend yield of 4.7%, and that payout is secure and well-funded. GM is making smart investments in technology and has a leading position in autonomous vehicles thanks to its 2016 acquisition of Cruise Automation, and its Cruise division has attracted multibillion-dollar investments   . The Chevy-parent has also taken a 10% stake in Lyft and is planning to launch its own autonomous ride-hailing service next year, which is currently being tested in San Francisco. Its Bolt and Volt EVs also give it a strong position in electric vehicles, and the company has the advantage of building them in conventional production facilities, unlike Tesla, for example, which has encountered numerous production challenges.  show that GM will continue to be a power player as the car industry shifts into autonomous and electric vehicles.Profit growth may be a challenge in the near term, but for a low-priced cash machine with a strong competitive position, GM looks like an excellent choice."
Why MannKind Corp. Soared 16.4% Tuesday,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 5:22PM
            
            ","After After   announced that it closed on its  agreement with  , its shares rallied 16.4% on Tuesday.MannKind only has one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug to its name, Afrezza, an inhalable insulin. Afrezza was launched in 2015 and sales have been far shy of optimistic pre-launch forecasts. As a result, investors have been fearing a cash crunch that could send the company into bankruptcy.However, insolvency worries abated this summer when United Therapeutics agreed to license a product in MannKind's pipeline that could one day compete with it. Specifically, United Therapeutics agreed to pay $45 million in upfront cash and potential milestones for rights to an inhaled version of its top-selling treprostinil, which MannKind's developing. As part of the deal, United Therapeutics also gave MannKind an additional $10 million for an undisclosed research project.The cash infusion is critical to MannKind's financial situation, so investors are cheering news today that the agreement closed without a hitch.The inhaled version of treprostinil that's being developed by MannKind uses the same Technosphere technology that's behind MannKind's Afrezza. There's no telling if MannKind's formulation will be successful in late-stage trials, but apparently, United Therapeutics believed the risk was significant enough to lock up rights. I can't say I blame them. Treprostinil is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, and that's a multibillion-dollar market.The extra cash should come in handy for MannKind, but it's not out of the woods yet. It's still burning through cash because operating expenses are outstripping its $3.8 million in quarterly Afrezza revenue, and that's likely to continue. Because Afrezza will remain MannKind's only marketed drug for awhile and spending is likely to continue to be a drain on its balance sheet, I think it's best to stay on the sidelines with this stock."
Is Costco Stock a Buy or a Sell After Earnings and Sales Results?,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 3:10PM
            
            ","   is one of the true survivors of the so-called ""retail apocalypse."" It hasn't just scraped by, but has continued to grow at an admirable rate. As a result, Costco stock has roughly doubled over the past five years, easily outpacing the S&P 500.Investors have gotten a lot of news to digest this month. The warehouse club giant reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of its 2018 fiscal year in the first week of October and released a sales update for September -- the first month of fiscal 2019 -- last week. Let's take a look at what these updates may mean for Costco stock going forward.Costco reported its sales results for the fourth quarter in early September, revealing a strong 7.2% increase in comp sales, excluding currency fluctuations and gasoline price inflation. Q4 net sales rose 5% despite there having been an extra week in the prior-year period.On Oct. 4, Costco filled in the rest of the details on its quarterly performance. Membership fee income climbed 5.7% to $997 million, as the benefit of  implemented in mid-2017 offset the impact of having one fewer week in the quarter.Earnings per share reached $2.36, up 13.5% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and in line with the average analyst estimate. Costco CFO Richard Galanti noted that EPS  excluding the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. That said, about 10 percentage points of this EPS growth was driven by a lower federal corporate tax rate. Higher interest income also contributed to Costco's earnings growth.Meanwhile, operating income ticked down slightly on a year-over-year basis, even though net sales increased by 5%. Thus, Costco's sales growth was offset by an operating margin decline. This was driven by a big wage increase implemented in June, along with a mix shift in terms of which merchandise categories posted the biggest sales gains.Lastly, Costco revealed in the earnings release that it will report a ""material weakness"" in its internal controls related to financial reporting. (IT contractors who were given access to sensitive data for various projects didn't have that access removed as quickly as it should have been after they finished, according to Galanti.) While the company doesn't expect to restate any earnings results, Costco stock still stumbled based on news of this mishap.On a brighter note, Costco recently reported another month of strong sales growth to kick off fiscal 2019. September comp sales rose 8.4% on a reported basis and 7.3% adjusted for currency fluctuations and rising gasoline prices, roughly in line with the company's fourth-quarter sales result.Costco posted strong sales growth in all regions of the world last month, driven by a 4.6% uptick in customer traffic at existing warehouses. Within the U.S., the Midwest and San Diego markets remain particularly strong, while Spain, Mexico, and Japan are  abroad.Looking at merchandise categories, softlines and hardlines were the standouts. With numerous major retailers having gone bust recently, Costco is likely to continue gaining share in apparel, appliances, home furnishings, and toys, among other categories.Despite increasingly difficult comparisons, Costco continues to deliver strong sales growth. On the other hand, Costco stock has a lofty valuation of 29 times forward earnings. This seems overly generous in light of the company's slowing earnings growth.The year-over-year revenue and earnings lift from Costco's membership fee hike peaked in the fourth quarter. This should have driven strong operating income growth given that membership fees account for the bulk of the company's earnings. Instead, operating income (adjusted for the extra week in fiscal 2017) rose less than 10% last quarter.Over the past few years, the combination of a new credit-card deal, membership fee hikes, and tax reform drove strong EPS growth. Costco won't be able to rely on those levers for the next few years. Its square footage growth rate has also moderated recently. As a result, it's not surprising that analysts expect EPS to rise just 9% annually in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020.It's hard to justify buying Costco stock for nearly 30 times its projected fiscal 2019 EPS when it may not produce a double-digit EPS growth rate in the foreseeable future. Costco is certainly a solid company that is likely to continue growing at a steady (but not spectacular) rate for years to come. However, investors should probably wait for Costco shares to retreat to a more palatable valuation before considering buying the stock."

Crude produced in the U.S., on the other hand, trades for about a $9-a-barrel discount to the global benchmark, with the gap even wider for those A barrel of oil currently fetches just over $80 on the global market. Crude produced in the U.S., on the other hand, trades for about a $9-a-barrel discount to the global benchmark, with the gap even wider for those . Given that the country is producing 11.1 million barrels per day (BPD) at the moment, this suggests that the U.S. oil industry is .It's a problem that   is quickly working to fix by building out new infrastructure that will provide U.S. oil companies with more access to global markets. In doing so, this under-the-radar  (MLP) will deliver high-octane growth for its investors, which could make them lots of money in the coming years.This past April, Phillips 66 Partners and its partner Andeavor, which   recently , said that they'd secured enough shippers to proceed with construction on the Grey Oak Pipeline system. The pipeline would move oil from Texas' Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale to its coast. The $2 billion oil pipeline will have the initial capacity to move 800,000 BPD, though it could be expanded to 1 million BPD depending on final shipper commitments and should be in service by the end of next year. That would help ease pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin, where producers are currently pumping out right around 3.6 million BPD, which is nearly at the limits of the region's current pipeline capacity.In addition to building the Grey Oak Pipeline, Phillips 66 Partners and Marathon Petroleum are also working with   to construct the South Texas Gateway Terminal. The facility will have the capacity to store 3.4 million barrels of oil and have two export docks capable of loading very large crude carriers (VLCCs), which can hold 2 million barrels of oil. Those tankers can then ship that crude to global markets, where it can fetch a higher price. The Buckeye Partners-operated facility has the potential to expand in the future to more than 10 million barrels of storage capacity as well as add multiple docks. The partners expect to finish this project at the end of next year, which would coincide with the completion of Grey Oak.Those are just two of a growing number of expansion projects Phillips 66 Partners currently has under way. The company is also building additional natural gas liquids (NGL) storage capacity that should come online in late 2020 as part of an  by its parent   at their Sweeney NGL hub. In addition to that, the partnership is building a unit at one of Phillips 66's refineries to increase production of higher-octane gasoline blend components. Further, it has several other smaller pipelines under construction, including two that will enter service by the end of this year.These expansions will provide Phillips 66 Partners with the fuel to continue increasing its distribution to investors at a high rate over the next few years. The company has already raised its payout 19 times since its formation in 2013, boosting it at a jaw-dropping 30% compound annual growth rate over that time frame. While the company likely won't maintain that pace in the future, it still expects to grow its distribution at a top quartile rate going forward, which implies at least a 10% annual growth rate. For a company that already yields 5.9%, that makes it an attractive option for income-seeking investors, especially when factoring in its top-tier financial profile.Phillips 66 Partners is working fast to address the oil industry's infrastructure constraints, which will enable oil producers to earn more money per barrel. Phillips 66 Partners, meanwhile, will haul in a steady supply income on these expansions, since oil shippers will pay fees to use these assets. Those fees will provide the company with more cash flow so that it can continue growing its distribution at a high rate. Add that growth to the company's already high-yielding payout, and Phillips 66 Partners has the potential to deliver substantial total returns in the coming years, making it an attractive MLP to consider buying these days."

Unveiling a Facebook camera that uses artificial intelligence to track you almost immediately after disclosing a major security flaw that will contribute to  with the company seemed astoundingly oblivious.Might as well double down! reports that Facebook is working on a device that can turn your TV into a video-calling device similar to Portal. The gadget, which will include a camera, would sit on top of a TV and allow users to make video calls, as well as watch things on Facebook's Watch platform. Facebook has dubbed the project ""Ripley"" internally, according to the report, and it uses much of the same underlying technology as Portal, such as the tracking technology.Facebook is reportedly targeting an early 2019 unveiling, although that timeline is subject to change due to a variety of factors.Portal hasn't even officially shipped yet, but the privacy concerns around the device are already mounting. Anticipating criticism, Facebook had initially said that it would not use any data collected by Portal for advertising purposes like targeting. The company was also quick to say it doesn't monitor or retain data around video calls, and that there would be no Facebook ads anywhere on the device ""at this time,"" leaving open the possibility of ad insertion later on.It turns out that Facebook use some of the collected data for ad targeting purposes, according to . While Portal still won't have any ads directly, the data around who users call or what apps people are using on Portal very much can be used for ad targeting, Facebook conceded in a remarkable reversal today. That's because Portal's voice calling is built on the company's Messenger infrastructure, so the service will collect the same types of data that Messenger does.Facebook product exec Rafa Camargo explained to the outlet that there was a misunderstanding with how Facebook communicated the technical details. What Facebook really to say was that it use the data but doesn't to. How reassuring.Facebook's efforts to push deeper into consumer hardware are being directly undermined by its ongoing privacy snafus. The company is failing to reassure users that it takes safety and security seriously, especially when it can't even properly explain how its own products will or won't use any user data that is harvested.Portal will be a commercial flop, and so will this rumored TV camera."

            ","  Q3 2018 Earnings Conference CallOctober 16, 2018,Greetings. And welcome to the W.W. Grainger third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operating during the conference, please press * 0 on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, VP, Investor Relations.Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Q3 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Tom Okray, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings.Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of our slide presentation and in our Q3 press release. Both are available on our IR website. D. G. will cover our performance for the quarter, and Tom will go deeper into our financials, including segment results. After that, we will open the call for questions. D. G., to you.Thank you, Irene. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. So, we had another solid quarter. Demand remained very strong in the third quarter. And we're continuing to gain share. In the US, as we lapped our August 2017 pricing changes, we are encouraged with our volume growth of 8% which eidetically outpaced the market. We're continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and midsize customers now that we've removed pricing as a barrier. We continue to grow faster in more profitable parts of the business, notably with our midsize customers. In addition, gross margin, when normalized for the revenue recognition accounting change and operating margin were both favorable to prior year. In Canada, the execution of our turnaround continues to make progress and is on schedule. We still expect to exit the year at a profitable run rate. Our single-channel online businesses, mainly Monotaro and Zoro, had strong growth and profitability.We recorded a non-cash impairment for Cromwell in the UK, reflecting slower growth than planned at acquisition. The overall international businesses are profitable with the exception of the impairments. We believe that our current exposure to tariffs is well understood and effectively managed. Tom will address tariffs later in the presentation. I would also mention two other things. 1) We had a very strong customer satisfaction reading in the US this quarter. It's actually the strongest we've seen under the current methodology. And also, with Hurricane Michael making landfall last week, I wanna note that all of our people are safe, and our team members are doing a great job responding to the event, as they always do. With that, let's take a look at our results. Third quarter 2018 reported results contain restructuring charges of $142 million and a $2.37 impact to EPS. In the quarter, we took a non-cash impairment of $139 million related to our Cromwell business.In 2015, we described to you the expected benefits of the acquisition based on the strength of the core Cromwell business, the ability to build the online model off of that core, and the potential in the UK market. Many of these benefits still exist. However, a few things have changed since the decision. First, Brexit occurred within a year of acquisition, and the market slowed. And the uncertainties surrounding Brexit as it gets closer to being executed forces us to take our growth projections lower. Second, the cost of capital is higher now. These two structural issues explain the majority of the reduction in valuation. In addition, our strategy included building an online model with the Cromwell name. In reality, this approach created customer conflict with the core business. We adjusted our approach and relaunched the online model under the Zoro name about a year ago. The opportunity with Zoro is large and compelling with very strong, early signals in the market.But the delayed start of Zoro and the lower growth rate given market conditions impact the current valuation. While still early days, we do believe the UK is an attractive place for Grainger to play. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Total company sales in the quarter were up 7%. That included 7% in volume, 1% in price, and a headwind due to foreign exchange and hurricane comparisons of 1%. This is the first quarter in 2018 with a foreign exchange headwind. Normalizing for foreign exchange and hurricanes, our sales increased over 8%.Our normalized GP rate was flat to the prior year after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change which we discussed earlier. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volume. This all led to operating earnings growth of 15% in the quarter and an operating margin that was 80 basis points higher than the prior year. Now, I'll turn it over to Tom for additional detail, including our segment results.Thanks, D. G. I'll cover our other business results first. As a reminder, other businesses include our single-channel online model and our international businesses. Sales for these businesses were strong, up 13% in the quarter, 14% driven by price and volume, partially offset by a 1% reduction related to foreign exchange. Our online businesses grew 23%, continuing to be a profitable growth driver. The international businesses were profitable, led by our Mexican operations. In Canada, the AGI turnaround is making progress. With many of our cost reduction initiatives behind us, we will now focus on growing profitably. Sales were down 20% or 17% in local currency. Price increases, branch closures, and sales coverage optimization activities contributed to volume being down 27%. This was partially offset by a 10% increase in price as we continue to renegotiate pricing on our large customer contracts.Moving to profit. In our comparison to the prior year, there were non-recurring adjustments related to excessive and obsolete inventory and vendor rebates that impacted gross margin. After adjusting for these items and normalizing for revenue recognition, our gross margin was 430 basis points favorable to the prior year. Operating margin improved 200 basis points, driven by favorable pricing and cost reduction. Adjusting for the non-recurring items, operating margin improved 570 basis points. Looking forward, we expect to exit the year with a positive operating margin run rate. In the United States, the demand environment was strong, and we were able to grow profitably. Our value proposition combined with continued favorable response to our pricing actions resulted in increased share. Sales were up 9% in the quarter. Volume was up 8%, and price was up 1% due to general inflation as well as lapping the price reset. In the month of September, hurricanes negatively impacted sales growth by 160 basis points.In 2017, Harvey and Irma had a larger benefit than Florence contributed in 2018. Normalizing for this impact, sales in September grew at 8% consistent with August growth for large and medium customers. After adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change, our normalized gross profit rate increased 20 basis points. Increase was driven by customer mix and favorable price/cost spread. Operating leverage continued to be strong in the US. Having said that, you will notice some lumpiness in the quarter related to two factors: increased variable compensation versus the prior year and the quarterly variable compensation true-up methodology. On a calendar year basis, these factors will wash out with sales growing significantly faster than operating expense. All in, operating margin at 15.1% improved 20 basis points versus prior year. Let's take a look at our large and medium customers.Despite lapping our pricing actions in mid-August, we continue to see strong volume growth from both large and mid-size customers. Our value proposition continues to resonate, and we are seeing the results. Our US large customer business is performing consistently. We are seeing strong performance with our non-contract customers, and spot buy purchases are increasing with contract customers. US medium volume growth of 22% is strong, especially considering a tough comp. New customers continue to be a meaningful contributor to volume growth. We're excited by what we're seeing. While we expect continued double-digit growth with medium customers, the rate of growth in Q4 will moderate. I wanna take a few minutes to go into more detail on tariffs and other issues. With respect to tariffs, we have deployed a cross-functional task force to gain a clearer understanding of the tariff impact as well as to execute mitigating action. The team meets daily, reporting to senior leadership at least weekly.Some of their actions include validating tariff increases, working with suppliers to minimize the cost impact including identifying alternative supply, and evaluating pricing actions while ensuring that our pricing stays market-based. With respect to quantifying the impact, product directly sourced from China represents about 20% of the US segment's cost of goods sold. This product is flipped between our national brands and our private label. National brands which comprise the majority are sourced from suppliers with manufacturing in multiple locations, providing flexibility and addressing the tariffs. Approximately half of the products sourced from China is impacted by 301 tariffs. Applying tariff raise of 25%, we estimate our cost will increase by about 2% for the US segment. Based on the task force work combined with our experience to date, we are confident that we can find alternative supply and/or price to cover the expected tariff cost increases.Moving to taxes, we want to ensure that the main drivers between reported and adjusted tax rate versus the prior year is understood. The Q3 reported rate of 32.7% is up 1 percentage point versus prior year. We have tax benefits from US tax reform and stock-based compensation. This was more than offset by the impact of the Cromwell impairment which is nondeductible and increased the rate by 16.3 percentage points. With respect to the adjusted rates, the Q3 rate of 20% is down 11.7 percentage points versus prior year. As with the reported rate, the adjusted rate reflects benefits from US tax reform and stock-based compensation. However, the Cromwell impairment is removed from our adjusted results and does not impact the adjusted tax rate. Finally, in July, we gave EPS guidance of $15.05 to $16.05. Further, we mentioned that it did not include the tax benefit from stock-based compensation for the second half. We have stayed away from predicting the exercise of stock-based awards which is inherently difficult.Excluding net benefit which was $0.14 in Q3, we are trending to the high end of our guidance. As a reminder, we will provide 2019 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January. I'll now turn it back to D. G. for closing remarks.Thanks, Tom. So, overall, we're very pleased with our continued strong momentum. We know that we have a compelling value proposition, that our team members are energized and focused on creating value for our customers. After lapping the price increases, the US continued to gain share at attractive margins. The turnaround in Canada is on track. We are now focused on profitable growth off of the business model reset. Our online model continues to show very strong, profitable growth, and our narrowed international portfolio continues to improve profitability. With that, I will open it up for any questions.At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press * 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press * 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the * keys. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.Hey. Good morning. A couple questions for me. So, first, based on some of my inbound emails, people are picking on the lack of the operating leverage in the US for this quarter. So, can you just discuss what exactly drove the variable comp true-up this quarter? And then can you confirm that this is a one-time event and that the US operating leverage will be strong in 2019?Yeah. As we said in our prepared remarks, the big impact that we had in terms of operating leverage was the true-up. We do this on a quarterly basis. And as our results for the year are very strong, we had put a disproportionate amount in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, throughout the year, this is going to wash out. If you normalize for that, we are going to see tremendous operating leverage with sales growing approximately twice the rate of operating expenses.Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, I know you're not talking about 2019. But on the last call, you stated you thought gross margins in 2019 could be stable with 2018. And now that we have more information on the contract price reset and an educated guess on tariffs, do you still think that you could have stable gross margins into next year?So, Ryan, we're working through all that. We will provide details in January as we announce earnings. I would say there's a couple of things that are pretty exciting. One is customer mix is a positive right now. So, midsize customers, non-contract customers growing faster than large contract. That'll be a benefit. We have to work through the specifics of the tariff. But we feel like we're on top of that. Our goal is to be as close to flat as we can be. And we think we've got the right process in place to get the best outcome.All right. And then maybe just lastly on tariffs before I turn it over. I know this is a tricky question as you're starting to have conversations with customers about pricing, but is your goal to protect gross profit dollars and maybe protect gross margin rate? Is that something you can comment on today?Our goal is always the same. We wanna be competitively priced, and we wanna get the best cost we can. Our expectation is that we will be able to pass through the price or find alternative sources to mitigate the impact of the tariff. And again, in January, we'll talk about where we think we land on that. We will know by then.Very good. Thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. So, SG&A at the company level -- adjusted SG&A was down a little sequentially despite the spike in the US comp catchup. Just wondering what was the offset there.Well, the offset is just the continued cost out productivity that we've been doing for the past several quarters.Yeah. I would also point to Canada as a big offset to that. We've taken about $85 million out of the cost structure in Canada. And most of those actions are behind us. And we got another benefit in the quarter there.Okay. Passing to GM, so, excluding the revenue wreck, company-level gross margin was flat with the US up 20 and Canada up more than that. So, just wondering were there some pressures in the other business's gross margin?The other business's gross margin is down slightly. You also have just the algebraic dynamic of their lower gross margin overall. And they're growing at a faster rate.The online model continues to grow very quickly. And it starts at a lower GP. And that has a big impact.Okay. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Good morning. I was wondering if I could start with the US segment in gross margin this quarter. Congrats on expanding it. Positive price cost and mix. I guess I'm wondering why the gross margin, when it has been a little bit better with that mix impact in the point of price, were there any other items within that? And then I'll just glue my second question on. And that's related to the tariffs. Is there any potential for inventory reevaluation associated with that? Is that something we have to think about for the fourth quarter gross margin?So, let me take the first part of the question first. What I'd point you to is taking a look at the sequential. Throughout the year, our gross margin typically declined. And if you look at how we're performing this year, it's at much less of a decline than we have had in previous years. So, we're very happening with what's happening in gross margin. One other thing that I'd point out is FX was a headwind this quarter. It's been a tailwind the previous two quarters. The dollar is getting stronger versus the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso.And then the second part of your question was around inventory reevaluation. We do not believe we will have any concerns there. And as a reminder, we're on LIFO. And I think we shouldn't have a problem, in any case.Great. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Thanks. And good morning, all. Just to drill down maybe a little bit on the tariff point that you raised on page 11, the first question is just the simple math on 25 on 50 on 20 I think is maybe closer to 2% than 2.5%. I assume those are just rounding points in all of it. Have you gone line by line there? Math there on 2% looks like it's under a dollar impact if you didn't have alternate sourcing or pricing action. Am I thinking about that the right way?Yeah. First of all, we're certainly going line by line. We just simplified it for presentation's sake. And as we noted in our prepared remarks, we think it's well understood and very manageable.Okay. And that math though makes sense as well?Correct.Okay. And just on the alternate sourcing point, just where you may have challenges or pricing or taking actions or are concerned about volume impact of those pricing actions, how are you thinking about your options there in terms of substituting supply?So, our team is looking very closely at pretty much a SKU by SKU level. And like all sourcing decisions, we look at the quality of the product. We look at the cost of the product. Depending on how the tariff plays out, we have alternative sources already in many places. And we may have to find some additional ones. But we just look at the total economics, total added cost, and pick the one that's got the best cost for the business. Much of our shifts could -- if it's China, if it's shifted, it could go either to India, to Mexico, or to the US depending on the nature of the product. The other thing I would say is as we're going through this, we have a fairly refined ship cost approach, looking at what the product cost should be. We understand what portion of the cost should be related to the tariff. And so, we are able to work with suppliers to make sure that we're actually taking the right cost increase. And that's a big focus for us.And how long do you think it'll take you to migrate once you make those decisions?Well, it depends. If we have an alternative source, it's actually pretty quickly. At this point, we don't feel like we're gonna be in a position where we're gonna have any disruption. And we feel like we're on top of this. So, we are not concerned about being able to make any changes we need to make.Okay. Great. I'll pass it on. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Luke Junk from Baird. Please proceed with your question.Good morning, guys. First question, D. G., Canada revenues slipped down again this quarter, by design, of course. Can you help us understand when run rate revenues should start to normalize? I think Tom mentioned in the prepared remarks that many of the cost reduction initiatives are now behind you. Basically, what kind of volume assumption is built into your operating margin guidance including this year heading into '19, broadly?And we'll talk in January about the specifics for what our volume expectations are for next year. We do expect volume to stabilize over the next several quarters into next year. And we expect next year to be more of a stabilization period. I would note a couple things. One is that the branch closures -- which are mostly behind us. There's still some to come -- have an impact on revenue. Also has a positive impact on profitability. We have reorganized our sales team. And coverage is now stable. And we're now talking to customers and trying to drive growth. And I think that will help us stabilize over the next year. I would say in general, it's hard to look at numbers that are down that much. And it's hard for the team. But this is what we expected. And I think the team's doing a great job of managing through that. And we're in a good position now to really create value for customers, improve service, and improve the conversations we're having. So, we're optimistic about stabilizing and being able to grow.Okay. And then second question on tariffs. What I'm wondering is do you approach recovering the tariffs differently by line of business, whether it's a different customer value proposition -- obviously, yours are impacted by your recent price actions -- or something like in Canada where some of the product is being imported from the US? Any thoughts you can share in respect to that?So, what I can say is that the cross-functional team we have has people from our sourcing, from our product management teams, people from our pricing teams and including our commercial teams all working together to make sure that we make the right decisions. I won't go into specifics about that. But in general, like I said before, we're really focused on making sure we get the right cost from our suppliers and have a competitive price. And so, that's really our fundamental principle in driving the results here.Perfect. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.Yes. Good morning, guys. Going back to the tariffs for those products, you mentioned half included [inaudible] Can you give any color in terms of what's currently not covered in terms of product categories? Any color there would be helpful.I don't know that we wanna go through the details of which ones aren't covered and are covered. But what we've seen is that the way 301 is written, there are a number of product categories that aren't included in this. And so, roughly half of what we have coming from China is really in that bucket today.Okay. And then on the impact you laid out, the 2% or whatever it is on the US cost, does that include any benefit from the weaker RMB? Or was that on an episodic basis? So, are you including the depreciation of the transcurrency in those calculations?No. The calculation was done on a constant currency basis.Okay. And then just quickly on the hurricanes, the 160-basis points impact. And you mentioned that there was some offset last year with the two hurricanes that weren't there this year. I just wanna understand what the difference is between last year and this year in terms of the benefits versus the impact.Yeah. So, what we do when we look at hurricane impact is we look at two things. We look at run rate business in the market that the hurricane hits. And we look at hurricane product sales into the markets that it hits. Last year, Harvey obviously had a huge impact on the Houston market which lasted for a long time. And then Irma hit Florida. Those two, combined, had a lot more hurricane sales offsetting the business slowdown. In fact, the Florida business slowdown was very fast. There wasn't' much of it. And this year, Florence did not have that much impact. It still had a significant impact on that market. But given it didn't hit in as highly populated area as Houston, the impact was a little bit less this year.Okay. Thank you very much.Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Thank you. Good morning, everyone.Good morning.Could we talk through the restructuring actions in the quarter? So, that was $142 million. Where do you stand in terms of the actions? How much are headcount? How much is footprint? Anything structural? And then expectations for the balance of the year.I'll turn it over to Tom in a minute. Most of that $142 million was the Cromwell impairment. And that was $139 of it. The rest were small in general. And most of the big changes in both Canada and the US are mostly behind us. So, maybe Tom can talk about --Yeah. Exactly. Taking out the Cromwell, there's some small severance items in our integration favoring North American winddown in the US. And then there's some residual branch closure costs and severance costs in Canada which is quite small and coming to an end.Got it. And then just wanna get -- I might have missed this. I apologize. But last quarter, you talked about some pricing delays in large US customers because of contract negotiations. But where did that stand? And how much of that has been run through the P&L?So, the vast majority of what we've done by the end of the year, we'll get 95% done by the end of the year. The contracts that aren't done are customer choices and/or implementation slowdowns depending on what we're talking about, in particularly, some government customers. But in general, we'll be mostly done. And we'll be talking about very small impacts going forward.Got it. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Evelyn Chow from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just starting on a comment you made on the medium customer, I think you noted that you expect 4Q to grow double-digits but for the rate to moderate. Just curious if that's just a function of harder comps, especially noting that your 3Q comps are probably even harder than your 4Q ones.Well, so I would talk about a couple things, Evelyn. Thanks for the question. So, one is remember, the third quarter, we made the change last year, August 1. So, part of the quarter was actually not under the new pricing. I would say we continue to be very encouraged and surprised by what we're seeing post-lapping the price changes in terms of midsize customer growth. Our models do not have us growing 30% forever, as you might guess. When we talk about moderating, we think it's gonna be moderating to a very strong growth rate. And we only had ten weeks after lapping the prices to really understand it. But I would say we are encouraged by what we're seeing. And we'll be more definitive at the end of the year, as we talk through it. But I'd say all signs are very, very positive on midsize customers, right now.That's helpful, D. G. And then apologies for an unoriginal question on tariffs but just curious. I think what you laid out in slide 11 is very helpful. I know the president has intimated that he is contemplating additional tariffs. In that event, have you thought about how to resense the math you laid out already? Is that going to be something closer to hitting the 30% of total company COGS that you've discussed in other forums?Yeah. So, first of all, we don't know how that will be implemented or if it will be implemented. So, like all these things, we are watching it very closely. But we don't have an opinion yet as to how that will play through. I would say, in general, obviously the tariffs are simply inflationary. And I think you see what the inflation is roughly based on the math we've seen so far. We think in the short-term, we would be able to navigate this no matter what happens. We think relative to competitors, we might be in a better position. The long-term impacts, we could all argue about over time. But certainly, in the short-term, we feel like we're on it and we know what we need to do depending on what happens.Understood. And then last question from me. I think you noted that your spot buy has been increasing with some of your contract customers. So, just curious to know what is the mix of your planned versus unplanned purchase now versus normal or maybe versus target?We don't typically talk about that specifically. And we'll take the question and think about whether at the end of the year we talk about it or not. But thanks. It's a great question, but we haven't typically laid that out.Great. Thanks, guys.Thanks, Evelyn.Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cieslak from Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question. Hey. Good morning.Morning.Morning. Just first, I wanted to go back to the guidance and just make sure we're clear on what you guys are saying. So, if I heard you right, you said that when excluding the $0.14 benefit from stock comp and the tax rate, you're running at the high end of your EPS guidance range. 1) Is that correct? And then 2) Does that assume then the other inputs to your guidance as it relates to both sales growth and gross margins are also running at the high end of your prior guidance?Yeah. It's a good question. I just wanna make it clear that we've raised guidance twice this year. And we're tracking toward the high end of that range. We're very encouraged by our performance. And I'd be disappointed if we don't beat guidance this year. With respect to your question on the other elements other than EPS, the same holds true. We're tracking toward the high end of the range. And Tom, would you say you also would be surprised if you didn't beat the high end of both sales and gross margin guidance? Or is that more of an EPS comment you made there?I would say it's more EPS, but we're always slugging it out with the other parameters as well.And I would say we're tracking toward the high end of all the dimensions that we laid out. So, obviously, we hope to beat them. But we're really tracking to the high end. Okay. Just to quickly close that question, I'd just be curious. Is there any reason why you're not giving more specific formal guidance on the full year? Is this a change in practice? Or just based on where we are in the year and some variability in the fourth quarter?It's really a transition in practice. We wanna get out of the business of giving quarterly guidance and giving a range and working toward a midpoint. Going forward, for next year, we'd like to give guidance once a year and then, quite frankly, not talk about it the rest of the year, talk more about the results we're putting on the board. Okay. And then for my other question, looking at the US volume growth, it continues to be strong. And you look at it on a two-year stack trend which we all do to try to get a sense of adjust for the prior year comps. It looks like it's flatlined a little bit and implies maybe into the fourth quarter, you're starting to run more in the mid-single-digits versus the high-single-digits for US volume all in. Is there something going into the fourth quarter as it relates to some of the marketing initiatives that maybe would reinflect that higher where you can maybe achieve something in the high-single-digits? Or is mid-single-digit volume growth the right way to think about at least near-term where the volumes might be growing?Yeah. So, we haven't really seen anything that suggests that we cannot continue to gain share and continue to grow. And like I said before, we're really encouraged by post-pricing changes, what we see in our large customer volume grew consistent with what had been growing before post-price change, and our midsize customer continues to grow. So, we would expect to be certainly north of five, if that's your question. And we expect to have strong revenue results going forward in the US. Okay. And then my last question, and I'll hop back into queue. When you look at the tariff related commentary that you guys gave in your exposure there, 20% of your COGS, I think the prior guidance or color that you gave was specific to private label. And I think what it was was something in that two-thirds of your private label, it was directly sourced from China. Is that still the case? Thanks. Or is that now maybe a little bit lower? Just when you do the math, it suggests maybe that's a little bit lower than what you guys were previously talking about. Thanks.Yeah. I think the confusion there would be two-thirds would be on a revenue basis. And given the GP on a COGS basis, it's roughly the math as you see it. So, that's the difference there. Got you. Okay. Thanks, guys.Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.Good morning, D. G. Good morning, Tom.Hi.First question just on the incentive comp and how it affected the OpEx growth. If I take that 400-basis point differential on 5% growth versus 9%, I'm in the $20 million range. Should I think of then the usual effect on the third quarter being three-quarters of that $20 million being compressed in one quarter versus four quarters?Yeah. We're not gonna get into the specific math, but you're thinking about it the right way.Okay. Great. Secondly, on the tariffs, I'm not sure I understood correctly on the private label, the merchandise. Is that private label merchandise stuff that you can redirect to other countries as it relates to where you supply from? And how much of that 20% is related to private label versus branded?So, private brands, we have a whole bunch of products that we buy in China that are private branded. In many cases, we already have alternative sources that are identified. And so, what we're referring to is if we have an alternative source, depending on how the math works with the tariffs, we may be looking to switch that. We may not be if the cost is still better in China post the increase. And so, the way we think about this -- some of it's risk mitigation. If we are buying something uniquely in China, we have to have an alternative source. And we will have it. If we're buying something that's only produced in China, and there are some products like that, then obviously, we don't have alternative source. We can go find them. And that's gonna be more work.Okay. Got it. And then the 25% tariff assumption, I assume that a good chunk of the imports from China are being tariffed at 10% today. So, how much of that impact today is at the 10% versus at the 25% rate? I'm assuming that you expect it to step up to 25% at year-end.Yeah. We assumed worst case for the calculation. So, we didn't take any credit for staying at 10%.And some of the 10%, it actually already started to flow as you correctly state.Okay. Do you wanna break out how much of the 10% versus the 25%? Or would you rather not?We'd rather not right now.Okay. Great. And then lastly, on the sales side, was there anything that was disappointing in terms of US sales, whether it be deceleration in natural resources or government customers, things that you would point to as falling short of your expectations in the quarter?I would say that pretty much all things US, revenue margin, all of it was positive in the quarter relative to our expectations. And of course, there was more uncertainty going in because of the price lap. And pretty much at every turn, it'd actually be what we expected to happen.Thank you for taking all my questions.Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.Yes. Hi. Good morning. I just have a question about US price which was positive to one in the quarter. I was just hoping you could give us just a little bit of color on the disaggregation of that because the price actions are still lapping. So, I'm assuming, of course, that the price actions were negative but that you had price increases and mixes in there as well. Could you give us any color on the buckets?Yeah. Sure. The way we look at the pricing is how much is commodity, vendor-related, in market levers, and then how much is related to the price reset. What we've seen is the decreases associated with the price reset has slowed considerably, as you would expect, as we work through the contracts. And we've been very consistent and actually improving in terms of the price we've been able to pass on related to tariffs and other market base.I would also say that the other element is customer mix was positive in the quarter which helps price. And we talked about spot buys. Spot buys increasing helps as well with large contract customers as we're not selling as much deeply discounted items.G., would you say that's the first or the second quarter that spot buy and medium-size customer mix has actually begun to read through?Boy, I think it's the second quarter that that's started to read through. Don't hold me to that, but I believe that's true.Okay. And lastly, again on the pricing. So, you have the price actions with the large customers. When you go back to those customers for price increases, could you walk us through -- were there upper bands and this kind of thing that slows things down? Or how do you work through that with those customers?Yeah. We won't talk about specifics. I would say we have a very tried and true process that we use to work through any changes with customers. And our commercial team does a great job of navigating with our customers to get the best outcome for both of us.Okay. Thanks.Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just had a couple clean-ups here. A lot's been covered already. Just on the tariffs, it sounds like you still expect to mitigate through alternate sourcing or pricing. Do you think you can offset the tariff cost right away? Or you think there might be some lag?So, given what we know now, there would not be a big lag. We think it would be -- given what we expect in terms of the 10 going to 25, we think we'll be roughly coincident, close enough.Okay. And then just a couple little clean-ups here. Can you tell me anything on branch count? I'm not sure if it was in the release or if it wasn't. I missed it. Just wondering what that looks like today versus the second quarter-end. I know you guys are still closing branches in Canada. Or I think you are.Yeah. We are. So, we will, by the end of this year, have 35 branches open in Canada. Most of them have already been closed. We closed seven in the quarter in Canada. And really, the rest is virtually nothing. The branch count's stable pretty much everywhere else.And as you've been closing these branches in Canada, have there been any gains from them? Because I haven't seen any of those running -- or I don't think you've called any of those out.Could you repeat the question?Have there been gains on those branches? I haven't seen them called out.Yeah. So, typically, they're smaller branches and not necessarily as valuable as the US branches in terms of sales.Yeah. The gains would obviously show up in our restructuring charges. And they're relatively small.Got it. So, those restructurings are net of gains?Yes. Correct.Yes.Got it. I understand. And then last couple, just in terms of the price write down, I'm not sure if you mentioned that, but are you done now with US large customer contracts?We talked about that before. By the end of the year, we'll be 95% done. So, mostly. The rest will be small. And that's almost all customer choice.Sorry. Yeah, I missed that. And then last one for me. Just Zoro US. How did that grow in the quarter?It continued to grow strong. Strong growth in Zoro US.Is it up, like -- I think you said 23% for total single-channel. Is it up at that kind of range? Or is it going down?It's not quite that. But it was up --It was up 18%-- 18% in the quarter. We're just looking at the number 18.Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.Thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just around price/cost. We talked a lot about pricing, but I think a few quarters ago, D. G., you had talked about COGS deflation. And as you know, there's a lot more inflation in the system now, whether you look at labor, freight, other items. Do you still expect COGS deflation going forward?So, no. What we talk about is price/cost spread and are we able to mitigate COGS increases and get the right price for our customers. This year, we had talked about being down half a percent. We still expect to be roughly there. That's mostly because of the initiatives we've done to manage our cost, to understand supplier cost and improve our cost structure. But otherwise, we would actually be in an inflation mode this year of 1% to 2%, probably.To be clear though, for the quarter, we did have product cost deflation.Yeah. We did.Good. Got it. Very helpful. And then last question. I'll turn it over. Just on the Canadian turnaround, D. G., Grainger's tried that for several years, as you know. This time, maybe just frame for us what's different this time in terms of strategy. I know you highlighted operating margin, run rate positive Q4. But just high-level, what's different in this turnaround versus past several years?Yeah. Well, this one is a lot more, I would say, intense in the sense that we've completely reset the business. We've combined the back office with the US and created North American centers of excellence. We've gone from 170 to 35 branches. We've completely restructured the sales organization. And all of that basically means we've taken about $85 million in cost out of the business. And we're now gonna start growing that business. We're adding some of the US assortment to that business, the ability to buy out of the US. We're really focused on diversifying the customer base throughout the business. And all those things I think will mean it feels very, very different and allows us to be much more consistent in the growth we see and the performance we see out of that business going forward.Okay. Wonderful. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed for your question.Yeah. Thank you. So, going back to what you just said about Canada, the 4Q positive operating margin exit is more on price and volume stabilization at this point, less on cost control like the branch closures that you just executed. And should we expect that you remain positive on a quarterly basis going forward?Yeah. You should expect that we remain positive going forward. A lot of what you're gonna see in the fourth quarter, it'll be the first time that you see really clean look at the cost structure as well. So, it's not just price and volume stabilization. It's also the cost structure getting to the new level.Understood. And incrementals have been solid year-to-date, averaging about 24%. As you think about tougher comps, you think about mix, volume, tariffs, if we see a mid-single-digit growth environment going into '19, do you think you could maintain a 20% incremental or better? Or should we be thinking high-teens given the puts and takes?Oh, I think we should be able to maintain a 20% or higher.All right. Thanks.Thank you.Our last question comes from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So, if we're gonna aspire to a framework of gross margins stable, does that imply a similar boost to mix from growth rates at the medium versus large today? Presumably, those are gonna slow, but do you still expect that ratio to hold that two for one or whatever?Yeah. We'll come back and talk to you about that in January, specifically. But our expectation is that midsize customers will be growing faster than the rest of the business. And that'll help us. That'll be a positive.Okay. So, that makes sense. If we back into -- it's a little bit of a follow-up on that variable contribution question. But if we back into the OpEx leverage, if you ex out restructuring, we're coming up with about 20%. And the genesis of my question is I think, D. G., earlier in the discussion, you or Tom alluded to the fact that perhaps restructuring was maybe tapering off. I'm curious because it seems like a lot of the OpEx benefit has come from restructuring, Canada and so forth. What's your trajectory for restructuring? Do you see as much opportunity to go after various projects in Canada or the United States? Or how should we think about that?Yeah. So, we've been running to a cost program that we talked about last year. We had been meeting or exceeding those expectations. We are in a good position now to make sure we improve our cost structure in 2019. And it comes across the entirety of the business. A lot of it actually comes from changes we have made recently, whether it's centralizing contact centers or going to the centers of excellence at AGI. All that flows through the P&L next year. I would also say that there's still great opportunity to improve the core big cost buckets in the US, whether that's getting more revenue per seller in the US, whether that's getting more lines per hour in the distribution centers.We're gonna have the Louisville distribution center up and running next year. More of our volume will then be going through automation which will help the cost structure. And we continue to get comfortable with the contact center footprint we have and getting more effective, more efficient there. So, the big cost buckets, we see a path to continue to improve the cost structure. We think that's gonna continue in the future.Makes sense. Just last one for me. Canada, I guess we had talked about a 4% to 8% margin rate in '19. What's changed in 2018 that prospectively makes that not a viable target or the low end or something like that? What ultimately changed in Canada this year? And maybe the 4% to 8% is still an aspirational target if we're going positive at the end of the quarter. How do you translate --We actually don't think anything's changed. That's still the range we're talking about.Okay. So, 4% to 8% is still on the table then?Yes. And we'll talk about what we think specifically in January.Got it. Thanks, guys.Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to D G. Macpherson for closing remarks.So, good. So, thanks for joining us today. I would just make a few points coming out of the call. Thanks for your questions. The first one is in the US, there was a lot of uncertainty going into the quarter about what happened when we lapped the prices. That actually has been very positive. Almost every metric we have in the US is looking positive in terms of our growth, our GP, our expenses, our customer acquisition. So, we're really excited about what we saw in the quarter from the United States.Canada turnaround continues to go well. It's very challenging, but we are in a good position now based on the new cost structure to drive growth and to be profitable going forward in Canada. The online model continues to grow and to grow at attractive rates. So, we're very positive there. And then the international business which is much narrowed is in a good position to continue to drive margins. So, we feel really good about where we're at as a company and where we're heading. And I really appreciate the time. So, thanks for being on the call.This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. "
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 3:12PM
            
            ","  Q3 2018 Earnings Conference CallOctober 16, 2018,Good morning, and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. -- Hello. This is Chris DelOrefice, Vice President of Investor Relations, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the Investor Conference Call to review Johnson & Johnson's business results for the third quarter of 2018.I am pleased to be joined for our discussion by Joe Wolk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide commentary on the quarter's financial performance, along with an update on our guidance for 2018. Additionally, I'm pleased to be joined by the leaders of our business segments, who will participate in our Q&A session. Joining me today in New Brunswick are Jorge Mesquita, Executive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman, Consumer; Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President & Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; we also have via phone Ashley McEvoy, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices.Thank you for your interest in Johnson & Johnson, and joining us on today's call. Our strong third quarter results included areas of strength across all segments of our business. Consumer's operational growth accelerated across all franchises in all major regions in our portfolio, and also benefited from the relaunch of our iconic Johnson's Baby brand in the U.S.Our pharmaceutical business demonstrated strong above-market growth, fueled by multiple innovative products. We continue to successfully navigate overall market dynamics and are confident in our proven business model to enable us to deliver sustainable growth.Medical devices continues to enhance market leading positions in many key platforms and delivered improved performance across more platforms than prior quarters to deliver on our goal of above market performance in 2020. Specifically, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures, we saw another quarter of improved growth in hospital medical devices, with almost a full point improvement versus the second quarter of 2018. As an enterprise, we continue to exceed near-term financial expectations while managing the business for the long-term to benefit patients, customers, and shareholders.A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. There, you can also find additional materials, including today's presentation and associated schedules. This morning's presentation includes forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review this cautionary statement regarding commentary included in today's discussion, as well as the Company's Form 10-K which identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected.Our SEC filings, including our 2017 Form 10-K, along with reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures utilized for today's discussion, to the most comparable GAAP measure are all available at investor.jnj.com. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. We anticipate today's webcast to last approximately 75 minutes.Now, I'm pleased to share our results for the quarter. Worldwide sales were $20.3 billion for the third quarter of 2018, a 3.6% increase versus the third quarter of 2017. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.5%, as currency had a negative impact of 1.9%. In the U.S., sales were up 3.6%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.5% with the effect of currency exchange rates reducing our reported OUS results by four points. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, operational sales growth was 6.1% worldwide, 3.9% in the U.S. and 8.5% outside the U.S. I will provide this same reference for each segment.With respect to earnings for the quarter, net earnings were $3.9 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.44 versus $1.37 a year ago. Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $5.6 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.05, representing increases of 7.3% and 7.9% respectively compared to the same period in 2017. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 9.5%. Joe will discuss earnings further in his remarks.Beginning, with consumer, I'll now comment on quarterly sales performance by business segment, highlighting items that build upon the slides that will be presented. Unless otherwise stated, percentages referenced represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2017. Or, in other words, results that exclude the impact of currency translation.Worldwide consumer sales totaled $3.4 billion, growing 4.9%. Excluding the net Compeed business Wound Care other franchise outside the U.S., total adjusted operational sales growth was 6.1% worldwide. Performance in the quarter was positively impacted by the restocking of retail inventory to support the relaunch of our Johnson's Baby portfolio in the U.S. that we highlighted last quarter. Excluding this impact, our adjusted operational growth was approximately 5.4%, representing above market growth for our consumer segment this quarter. Beauty led the consumer segment performance, growing 6.5%, or just above 8% when adjusting for divestitures, primarily Nizoral.The U.S. realized strong category consumption and growth, including continued strong performance in e-commerce. The Neutrogena brand delivered strong results, primarily reflecting growth in facial moisturizing and share gains in sun protection. Additionally, the OGX and Maui Moisture brands delivered strong performance, growing share globally. Results outside the U.S. were also driven by the Asia Pacific region, where Dr.Ci:Labo and Neutrogena brands had strong uptake. OTC also delivered strong results, growing 6.8%, or slightly above 6% adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures, mainly our recent acquisition of Zarbee's.In the U.S., we grew overall category market share by 0.6 points versus prior year, with strong consumption across many key categories, such as upper respiratory, including Zyrtec for allergy relief, Imodium for digestive health, and Tylenol and Motrin in analgesics. We also delivered strong growth outside of the U.S. across our portfolio, led by performance in antismoking aids driven by new product innovation.As previously referenced, we successfully relaunched our Johnson's Baby product line, and achieved growth of 4.3% this quarter. Excluding the benefit of the retail inventory restocking, the business was essentially flat versus prior year. While it is early, we are excited about the progress of the relaunch as we realize strong consumption in the month of September.Moving on to our pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $10.3 billion grew 8.2%, with double digit growth in nine key products, resulting in continued above market performance. The segment was led by performance of the oncology portfolio growing about 39% globally. Darzalex continued its strong performance, growing globally by approximately 60%.In the U.S., market growth and strong launch uptake of the one prior line indication is resulting in share gains. Outside the U.S., Darzalex is experiencing increased penetration and share gains in the 31 EMEA countries where it is commercially available, as well as in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region where it gained approval late last year. This strong broad-based volume growth was partially offset by a one-time adjustment outside the U.S. related to accruals for retroactive reimbursement matters which negatively impacted worldwide Darzalex growth by 16 points.Imbruvica grew approximately 40% globally, with growth in the U.S. of 45%. Based on second quarter data, Imbruvica gained approximately three points of market share versus prior year across all lines of therapy, largely driven by share in line one chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL. The CLL line one market is estimated to have grown approximately 14% in the same period.Zytiga grew approximately 45% due to continued strong market growth and share gains, primarily from the expanded indication in metastatic high-risk castration sensitive prostate cancer, based on the LATITUDE clinical trial.In nonmetastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, we continue to be pleased with the launch progress of Erleada, with the penetration of subscribers split evenly among urology and oncology practices. In Immunology, we delivered global sales growth of 5%, driven by continued strong performance in Stelara of 17% and Simponi ARIA of approximately 15%, offset by continued erosion of Remicade of 15% due to competition from biosimilars. Remicade has maintained approximately 93% of the infliximab volume share. We remain very pleased with the uptake of Stelara in Crohn's disease, where market share has increased approximately seven points compared to the third quarter of 2017.Lastly, sales of our newly launched treatment for psoriasis, Tremfya, totaled $171 million globally. Tremfya is experiencing strong demand, with over 25,000 patients on therapy, and achieved a 5.8% share of the psoriasis market in the U.S.In Neuroscience, our paliperidone palmitate long-acting injectable portfolio delivered strong global growth of approximately 18%, driven by new patient starts and persistency. We did experience negative growth in our cardiovascular, metabolism, and other product portfolio, primarily driven by declines in Invokana. Additionally, Xarelto declined by 3.6%, with continued share growth being offset by increased rebates, including approximately six points of a negative impact from prior quarter adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, Xarelto's underlying growth would've been approximately 2.5%.Subsequent to the quarter, the U.S. FDA approved Xarelto for a new 2.5 milligram vascular dose, making Xarelto the first and only Factor Xa inhibitor to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as CV death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in people with chronic coronary or peripheral artery disease. This indication significantly increases Xarelto's treatable patient population by approximately 13 million patients in the U.S.In pulmonary hypertension, we realized strong growth in both Opsumit and Uptravi. Opsumit grew globally approximately 21% with similar growth both inside and outside the U.S. And Uptravi grew 38% globally. Both driven by further market penetration and increased share. As expected, Tracleer is declining as generics entered the European market during the second half of last year.I'll now turn your attention to the medical devices segment. Worldwide medical devices sales were $6.6 billion, growing 1.7%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestiture of Codman Neuroscience, adjusted operational sales growth was 2.9% worldwide. This growth represents and acceleration versus the first half of 2018.We continue to strengthen our market leading positions in our electrophysiology and vision businesses while also improving performance in spine and knees in our orthopedics portfolio. Growth was partially offset by declines in our diabetes care business.Subsequent to the quarter, we announced the completion of the divestiture of our LifeScan business, which is consistent with our approach to strategic portfolio optimization.Interventional solutions grew 19.4% globally, with continued strength in our electrophysiology business, which grew more than 23% worldwide, fueled by our market leadership position in the space from newer product offerings in ablation and advanced catheters contributing to atrial fibrillation procedural market growth. This represents the highest growth we have realized in any quarter over the last nine-plus years of double-digit growth. Additionally, we've realized strong double-digit growth in our Cerenovus business, fueled by new product innovation, including the launch of Embotrap, for the treatment of ischemic stroke.Moving to our vision business, the contact lens business continued to grow above market at 6.2% worldwide on the strength of the astigmatism and daily disposable lenses in the Oasys family. In vision surgical, worldwide growth of 4.1% was driven by international intraocular lens growth in cataracts.In orthopedics, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the divestitures of Codman Neuroscience and Prodisc in spine, performance was flat to third quarter 2017. In hips, we grew market share, leveraging our leadership position in the anterior approach and continue to see strong demand for the primary stem ACTIS.Trauma was flat due to lower market growth, along with continued pricing pressure in the U.S. market. As the clear market leader in this segment, we continue to see strong adoption of newer innovation, such as our TFNA femoral nail. Performance improved in both spine and knees, although we are committed to doing better. Spine performance improved for the third straight quarter, driven by new products such as the CONCORDE LIFT Expandable Interbody Implant, and the VIPER PIME System for minimally invasive surgery.Our performance in knees accelerated to approximately 1% growth due to the continued strong uptake of the ATTUNE Revision System, and aided by the one-time impact of price legislation in India in 2017. Pricing pressure continued to impact all categories in orthopedics. For the quarter, U.S. pure price was negative across all platforms by approximately negative 6% in spine, negative 3.5% in hips, negative 2.5% in knees, and negative 2% in trauma.We were very pleased with the results for the surgery group. The advanced surgery performance was strong, led by double digit growth outside the U.S. On a worldwide basis, endocutters grew 10% and Ener-G grew 4.5% as new products are experiencing strong demand, especially outside the U.S. Biosurgery grew over 9%, driven by strong demand fueled by new innovation such as SURGICEL Powder.In general surgery, wound closure grew 3.5% with growth in all regions as barbed and plus sutures are experiencing strong adoption. Selling days had a negligible impact on medical devices in Q3. And, as previously communicated, we don't expect a material impact globally for the remainder of this year, though there could be some variances by region.As a final comment regarding the U.S. hospital setting, let me provide utilization trends. For the second quarter of 2018, we saw an increase in hospital admissions of about 1.5%. Surgical procedures were up approximately 1%, and lab procedures were up about 2%. Our preliminary estimates for the third quarter indicate a modest decline in hospital admissions growth to 1%, with surgical procedures and lab procedure growth consistent with the second quarter at approximately 1% and 2% respectively.That concludes the sales highlights for Johnson & Johnson's 2018 third quarter. For your reference, this slide summarizes notable developments that occurred in the third quarter, some of which were mentioned in my comments.It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Joe Wolk, who will provide further insights on Johnson & Johnson's quarterly financial results. -- Thank you, Chris. It is great to have you in the investor relations role. Good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter results, a product of the effort and contributions made by our Johnson & Johnson colleagues around the world. Our performance reflects the progress we're making against the robust strategies and plans that we have put in place across all three segments, and that we've been sharing with you throughout 2018.I'd also like to welcome Ashely, Jorge, and Jennifer to today's call. These are performance-based leaders who embody our cradle-based culture. We all look forward to answering your questions about our business later in the call.Since Chris already provided many details on sales, I'll provide only a brief few comments on revenue before focusing the discussion on cash, the income statement, and guidance for the remainder of 2018.In consumer, we're very encouraged by the third quarter results, which are consistent with our plan to deliver above market performance in the year that we shared at Analyst Day. Over the counter medicines and beauty continue to thrive, and we are very pleased with the early positive feedback related to our Johnson's Baby relaunch. We launched in the United States, China, and India during the quarter, and we plan to continue the full global rollout into 2019.Our medical devices performance is also consistent with our Analyst Day plans. The third quarter reflected accelerated strength in already strong franchises, such as electrophysiology, biosurgery, and endocutters, and improvement in areas that underperformed in recent quarters -- most notably, spine and knees. The third quarter is a positive step toward our goal of returning to above market performance by 2020.In pharmaceuticals, we continue to be an industry leader across many performance measures, including sales growth, R&D productivity, and commercial capabilities. While we'll face tougher comparisons in the pharmaceutical segment through the remainder of this year, as well as biosimilar and generic competition, we are confident in the strength of our business. Our growth, as in prior quarters, is the result of our approach to innovation and delivering transformational products. Our growth continues to be driven by volume rather than price.Being broadly based in healthcare allows us to continue to seek opportunities where we can uniquely drive value through our cross-segment collaboration and external partnering. One example is in the managed care setting, where we are combining our patient and provider insights, our behavioral science expertise, and our human centered design methods to enable a health insurance customer and a retail customer to collectively deliver a better experience for a priority patient population. This kind of collaboration is indicative of how we live into our credo and our commitment to ensure that good health is within reach for everyone everywhere. We will continue to use our broad base to provide new solutions in healthcare and meet the needs of patients and consumers globally.Starting with cash, I will now highlight other key financial activity for this quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $12 billion of net debt, which consists of approximately $19 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $31 billion of debt. Regarding our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2018, please direct your attention to the box section of the schedule. As referenced in the Table of Non-GAAP Measures, the 2018 third quarter net earnings are adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of $1.7 billion on an after-tax basis, driven by intangible amortization of $1 billion and an in-process R&D charge of $900 million, which is primarily related to the partial writedown of Alios BioPharma, as noted in this morning's press release.Excluding the impact of those items, our adjusted earnings per share is $2.05, exceeding the mean of analyst's estimates and an increase of 7.9% versus the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $2.08, up 9.5% versus the third quarter of 2017.I'd like to now highlight a few noteworthy items that have changed on the statement of earnings, compared to the same quarter last year. Gross profit margins for the quarter improved by 280 basis points, primarily driven by favorable business mix as well as the impact of the Actelion inventory step-up charge recorded in 2017. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.3%, which is lower than the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to the timing of investments.Other income and expense was a net expense of $3 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $297 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items recorded in this line, other income and expense was lower with a net gain of $32 million in 2018, compared to a net gain of $578 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the sale of the consumer Compeed business in the third quarter of last year.Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 17.6%, compared to 20.8% in the same period last year. This rate is consistent with our expectations as a component of the full year effective tax rate. The lower rate compared to the third quarter of last year is the result of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We anticipate the U.S. Treasury will issue further regulatory guidance later this year, specifically related to foreign tax credits and expense allocation against international income. Our tax rate guidance, which I will provide shortly, reflects these anticipated developments.Let's now look at adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2018, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise declined 20 basis points versus the third quarter of 2017. Looking at the adjusted pre-tax income by segment, medical devices at 27.1% is lower than the previous year, primarily due to investments in the business.Pharmaceutical margins improved by 380 basis points to 44.8%, driven by favorable product mix and timing of research and development spend. Consumer margins declined to 17.1% due to a prior year divestiture gain previously mentioned, partially offset by investment spend.Turning to guidance for you to consider as you update your models. Our sales guidance for 2018 continues to include erosion due to the biosimilar competition impacting Remicade, continued generic competition for Concerta and Velcade, and the expected generic and biosimilar competition to Tracleer and Procrit later this year. Our guidance ia based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is consistent with past guidance practice and the way we manage our business to provide the best understanding of our underlying performance. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2018 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.For the full year 2018, we are comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales of 5.5-6% for the year, an increase over the guidance we provided in July. This growth would result in sales for 2018 on a constant currency basis of approximately $80.6-81 billion. We expect that operational sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures will be between 4.5-5% for the year, also an increase to our previous guidance.Although we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, utilizing the euro spot rate relative to the U.S. dollar as of last week at $1.15, the positive impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 0.5%. This rate is below previous guidance, which assumed a spot rate of $1.17, and results in a 30-basis-point reduction in growth compared to that previous guidance. Therefore, under this scenario, we expect reported sales growth in the range of 6.0-6.5%, or approximately $81.0-81.4 billion. Again, this is higher than our previous guidance due to our operational strength.Our adjusted pre-tax operating margin guidance remains relatively unchanged. Although year-to-date performance suggests even greater improvement, we expect investments in the fourth quarter will result in the full-year pre-tax operating margin improvement of at least 150 basis points. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $450-500 million. This is lower than previous guidance as we benefit from an increase in interest income from higher rates.Regarding other income and expense, we would be comfortable with your 201 models for reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.5-1.7 billion, which is consistent with our previous guidance. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales, and write-offs. This would include the gain associated with the divestiture of the LifeScan business announced subsequent to the quarter, but does not include the divestiture of our Advanced Sterilization Products business, which we expect to close in 2019.Moving on to taxes, our effective tax rate guidance for 2018, excluding special items, is approximately 17.5-18%, reflecting a tightening of the previous range. Considering all of these factors, we are comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $7.98-8.03 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational of constant currency growth of approximately 9-10%, which is higher than our previous guidance, again reflecting the strength of our business.We are not predicting the impact of currency movements. But, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, using recent exchange rates, our reported adjusted EPS will be positively impacted by approximately $0.15 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $8.13-8.18 per share, reflecting growth of approximately 11.08% at the midpoint, which is also higher than our previous guidance.That concludes our financial summary. I will now turn the call back over to Chris for the Q&A portion of the call where, again, I am very pleased to be joined by Ashley, Jorge, and Jennifer. Chris? -- Great. Thank you, Joe. We will now move on to the Q&A portion of today's discussion....Rob, can you please provide instructions for those on the line wishing to ask a question?Sure. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. -- Good morning. Maybe a few questions. Because we have so many people on the call this morning, I'll be quick. Joe, I just want to start with one for you, and then one for Jennifer, and one for Ashley. So, Joe, just the guidance you gave here for the year. I'm just doing some net math here. It seems like margins for the fourth quarter are somewhere around the mid-20s, which is consistent with your historical spending into the fourth quarter. I just wanted to get a sanity check on that. And, as we think about next year on other income, is it reasonable to expect other income levels in '19 similar to '18? And I have two quick follow-ups. -- Yeah, so good morning, David. Good to hear from you. I would say, with our margins for the fourth quarter, I would stand by the guidance that we just gave. You might have noticed the slight tweak in language. We've gone from approximately 150 basis points to at least 150 basis points. So, we'll plan to invest in the fourth quarter much as you've seen in previous years. With respect to other income and expense, I prefer to hold off until January when we give you 2019 guidance. I think it's fair to say that we've commented in the past, for quite some time now, that when we do see a lessening of other income on that line, we will adjust accordingly with our operating margins. -- Okay. Very clear. And then I'll ask my two questions here together. First, for Jennifer, just your growth Zytiga this quarter was around, I think, 6%. Is that a good way to think about 2019 pharma growth? And can you just give us an update on where you're coming out on -- whether the fourth quarter implies an impact from Zytiga?And then, just Ashley -- and congrats, by the way, to both of you on the new positions. But, the ortho base was stable overall, but the U.S. knee franchise, obviously, remains under pressure. Can you just give us a sense of how much of this is ATTUNE perception issues versus robotics? And what's the pathway to recovery in U.S. knees? Thanks so much. -- Great. Well, let me start in there. Good morning, David. First of all, we're really pleased with our third quarter performance for the pharmaceutical sector. So, the 8.2% operational growth, which is above the market, and growth coming -- that's broadly based across the portfolio with Nike brands achieving double-digit growth and very strong performance as we look across the globe. As you noted, if we actually remove Zytiga from that mix, our growth was 6.6% operationally -- so, really, really strong performance. And so, I think, with Zytiga, it shows and demonstrates, while we're pleased with Zytiga, we're absolutely not dependent on it.As Joe indicated, we're not providing any guidance right now for 2019, and in previous sessions we've discussed the process and legal challenges that are under way. Right now, we're in the process of waiting for a court ruling on Zytiga and our stay ends at the end of October -- October 28th, I believe. So, we're not going to make any speculations or predictions on that. But, we're very, very please with the pharm performance overall and very, very broadly based throughout the portfolio. -- Ashley, do you want to -- -- [Crosstalk] David, good morning -- sure. No, I think for knees, with quarter three, I think you saw a little bit of a stabilization in quarter three in North America versus quarter two. We expect that to improve as we continue the rollout of our ATTUNE revision, which has gotten a very health uptick. And, as we launch the cement less program in 2019, and then progress our digital surgery offering in Orthotaxy following in 2020, obviously, coupled with very strong commercial excellence. Thanks for the question.Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. -- Good morning, thanks for taking the question. So, just, Joe, a couple of follow-ups on David's questions earlier. So, I know you're not giving 2019 guidance until January, but maybe you can help us think about some of the headwinds and tailwinds we should be thinking about. Some of the ones that people are interested in specifically are currency. We estimate it's about a 100-basis-point headwind right now. And Remicade erosion -- how that might compare in 2019 to 2018. And I had one follow-up. -- Sure, Larry. Good morning. Good to speak with you. I think probably the best way for me to comment on currency is to say that we provide guidance on our operational performance, and then just an estimate based on what the current spot rates are at the time. This year, it was much less of a tailwind than we thought when we were speaking with the investment community back in January. We thought it would translate into about $1.5 billion of additional revenue reported. It's only turning out to be about 25% of that, but we've been able to take up guidance based on just the solid operational strength of our underlying business.So, I won't comment because it's just much too speculative as to what next year may hold with respect to a strengthening dollar. And your second question, with respect to Remicade, I would say that's -- I wouldn't expect any kind of step change. I think what you're seen this year is roughly 18% in the U.S. with biosimilar erosion. We continue to compete there. Most of that erosion is related to price and we're going to continue to do that because we know that that's what patients and healthcare providers actually see as a product of most comfort. So, based on the safety and efficacy that we've demonstrated for a number of years across all indications, we feel pretty strong that it still has a very strong place in the market.And the good news, as we said, before biosimilars launched is the immunology portfolio with the expansion of the Stelara label, as well as the introduction of Tremfya, continues to grow in spite of Remicade's erosion. -- And, Joe, you grew organically about 6% year-to-date, including about 6% in Q3. Can you walk us through what your guidance assumes for organic growth in Q4? I'm getting to about 2% at the midpoint and I'm wondering why you're assuming such a deceleration. Could you just help us bridge that? Thanks for taking the questions. -- Sure thing, Larry. I know I can count on you for a math question. So, let me give you some things to think about. Obviously, we don't provide quarterly guidance, but I realize we've got three quarters into the year, so it becomes somewhat of a plug. But let me give you the qualitative thins to consider as you model Q4, which we think are somewhat temporary or fleeting in nature. We do expect medical devices to continue that modest improvement quarter-on-quarter strengthening in areas where we're already strong, and then improving some of those areas that have underperformed in recent quarters.We do think we've turned the corner with consumer. We want to see more data points with that, but the growth that belies this quarter, of 6% adjusted operational -- there's a slight, I would say, downward revision for that, given some of the Baby stocking. But, you're still into the mid-five range. We think that's going to continue because it's underpinned by the Baby franchise being rolled out across the globe. We're seeing strong receptivity for those products here in the U.S., China, and India. And then, OTCs and beauty/skincare continued to perform at 6% levels.With pharmaceutical, you have some unique adjustments. I would say there's going to be some new generic and biosimilar entries with respect to Tracleer and Procrit that we anticipate, and is in our thinking for guidance in the fourth quarter. We'll see continued erosion that wasn't around fourth quarter of last year with respect to Concerta and Velcade. We do have much higher comps with respect to pharmaceutical business, as you know, and the second half of 2017 is really when that business reaccelerated its strength.And then, lastly, there's a gross to net accrual that we'll be making related to 2019 activity as we get ready for the new year. We have inventory out at wholesalers and we accrue on those rebates. And, just given the size of our business and some of the contracts that we see coming through, we think that's going to be a little bit of an impact in the fourth quarter here. -- Thanks for taking the questions. -- Thanks, Larry.Your next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. -- Thank you. Joe, just a big picture, strategic question. J&J seems to be stuck in a pattern of pharma outperforming but MD&D underperforming. And while you are starting to see evidence of improvement in certain pockets of that business, I think relative to your peer group, J&J's business has been a pretty visible underperformer. I'm just wondering -- and this is a narrative that we've seen for many, many years now. Are you satisfied with that narrative? And, if not, what would it take to jump-start that narrative? And what would it take to jump-start the MD&D business? Will it require a large-scale transformative deal, which I think you've somewhat alluded to? Or is it more likely that you would stick to tuck-in deals? Is that the right way to look at it, or do we just need to be patient and wait for new products to reach the market so that -- I think your guidance is that this business would start to grow in line or better than the market by 2020? Just wondering if you could address that.And then, I have a follow-up question of the pharma business. Just, if you exclude Remicade, I'm just curious if prices or rebates have changed much in the immunology franchise, just given how crowded that space ahs become. Thanks very much. -- Well, thanks for the question, Jami. I'll kick off the answer and then maybe kick it over to Ashley to talk a little bit more about the plans for going forward in medical devices. But, I would say, comparing us to the peer group in med devices could be a little bit misleading. I don't know that anybody's got the breadth or scale that we have when you just look at the level of revenue. There's maybe one other competitor that's notable and we outperform them. That being said, we are not satisfied with the performance in medical devices. We're seeing improvements. Whether that's going to take a transformational deal or a tuck-in deal, we're looking at all of them across all segments of our businesses. We want to make sure it's a good strategic fit, and that we can create value, not just for the company, but for shareholders going forward.Ashely, maybe you can comment on a few things that will continue this upward momentum that we started in medical devices. -- Yeah, Jami. Thanks for the question. I guess I would offer to ground us on where we come from and, clearly, where we aim to be. And, what we're fortunate to be is in a very strong position with number two in med tech. And we have half of our platforms growing above the market. And we've got very competitive profitability and very competitive free cash flow. So, with, I would say, a very strong purpose of what we do every day of helping people. So, with that at our back, clearly we're very focused on flipping each of those platforms that we're dissatisfied and have been underperforming the market. And our strategy to achieve this has really been through accelerating innovation.You've heard us speak around 15-20 new products, and many of those are having very strong traction in the marketplace. I use examples like some of the spine innovations have been enabling some of that spine performance. I expect some of the innovations in the ATTUNE revision, and getting on that list, will help us with knees. I expect some of the innovations that we're launching in Ener-G and in endocutters -- particularly around the Echalon Flex -- will help us. We've also been doing a lot of different M&A deals. We've done about 26 deals this year -- five of them have been acquisitions, 10 equity investments, two of them are divestitures -- one of which will hit in quarter four, which is diabetes. The other one will be ASP, which is early 2019. And then, several other co-promotes.So, I think we are very focused on accelerating those platforms that are, in fact, growing above the market. We're relying on that strength. Feeding the ones that are underperforming through innovation, M&A, and commercial excellence. And, obviously, we're always look at transformative M&A, but we haven't modeled in any of that. -- Great. Thank you, Ashley. And, Jennifer, maybe you can address Jami's question regarding pricing of pharmaceutical X-Remicade. -- Yeah. And I believe Jami's question also was fairly focused in on immunology as well. -- Mm-hmm. -- And so, we definitely are seeing continued pressure on pricing in immunology as both the payers are working to extract greater rebates and discounts and also as there's increase in competition in the key categories. However, that being said, I think, given our strategy with being a transformational medical innovator, the types of products that we're bringing forward, the data that we're bringing forward, and the types of analytics and things that we're doing in partnering with customers -- I think we're really well positioned to continue to compete and to be able to succeed in the market. If you take a look at our products X-Remicade in the immunology category, we've got very robust growth. Taking a look at X-Stelara, with that growth being led by our Crohn's indication -- Tremfya, which is really making significant inroads in psoriasis. And also, Simponi and Simponi ARIA.And so, even if you include Remicade, we're continuing to grow. Outside of that, with the others, we've got very robust growth. So, going back, our growth really has been driven largely by volume, and expanding our reach, and reaching greater number of patients. And I continue to believe that that's how we'll be deriving our growth going forward. So, yeah, market is heating up in terms of discounts and rebates, but I think we're well positioned to be able to continue to compete successfully. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. -- Great. Thanks very much. Just two here. Maybe, first, another one on drug pricing. I guess, as we look out to 2019, and now you have a bit more clarity on some of your contracting, should we expect any major shifts in price dynamics for your pharma business next year based on these conversations, or should we think about a similar dynamic that we saw in 2018? My second question was on Darzalex, and as sales were maybe a bit below expectations. I think you mentioned so ex-U.S. price adjustments impacting results. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the trends we're seeing with the product and what specifically is happening ex-U.S. on pricing? Thank you. -- Sure. So, on the pricing front overall, I think, as we look into 2019, and what we're seeing in the contracts, I think we're going to see continued evolution in some of the categories where there are a very high level of competitors. But it will be an evolution in pricing, not a revolution or a step change. But it definitely continues to be an area of focus for the payers, and we're in that heavily contracted category. If we take a look at Darzalex, it had very strong performance with 60% growth worldwide, sales nearly $500 million -- and it was very strong, both based in the U.S. and ex-U.S. What you're referring to, and what we had mentioned related to ex-U.S., is that we did have a one-time adjustment related to accruals for retroactive reimbursement. And that negatively impacted the Darzalex worldwide growth by 16 points.This is just a normal adjustment as we negotiate with governments to get reimbursement in some of the ex-U.S. markets. And we see this as a normal course of business and really a one-time adjustment. But Darzalex, overall, demonstrating very, very strong growth and another strong quarter. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.-- Hi. Good morning. Two questions for Jennifer on the pipeline. Two key drivers over the next couple of years -- Erleada, which was just launched, and then Esketamine, which you're hoping to launch in 2019. So, Jennifer, on Esketamine, I'm just wanting to get your sense of confidence in FDA approval. The reason I'm asking is you did five phase IIIs. Three were positive -- I think two missed their primary end points, but nonetheless very good safety data. So, what's your confidence in approval? Do you think we may need an FDA panel for Esketamine?And then, on Erleada, I know you're not giving the actual sales numbers, but when we track IMS data, Erleada is off to a slightly slower start than we would've expected. So, maybe talk about your expectations for Erleada as well. Thanks. -- Perfect. So, for Esketamine, we're really excited about Esketamine's potential for treatment resistant depression and also, hopefully in the future, major depressive disorder. And, for those patients who are at eminent risk of suicidality. Both of those products -- or programs, excuse me -- have FDA breakthrough designation, which represents the significant unmet medical need. We are really confident in the totality of our data across the Esketamine program, and what we have filed -- both with the U.S. authorities as well as the EMEA authorities. It's really difficult in these types of trials, to prove success. As you know, as you take a look across the industry -- and we believe that, across the totality of our data, we've got a very, very robust program and robust data and are hopeful and optimistic for approval.In terms of an FDA panel, I don't know if we have heard back from the agency yet if we will have one or not. They are typically standard for first in class, or new, mechanics. So, I think our team is going to anticipate and prepare for one. And, a soon as we -- I don't know if we have the actual answer on that, but that would not be unusual in any respect. I think the default is everyone gets a panel unless the agency says no on that.And the other question was on Erleada. So, we have launched Erleada in the U.S. I believe we're not yet reporting sales on that in terms of numbers. We're pleased with the uptake. As you know, with Erleada, this is in the pre-metastatic setting, so it's in the earlier course of disease -- both urologists and oncologists prescribe for it. There is very strong, both awareness and receptivity, to the profile, the data, and the label. And so, there's very strong interest in prescribing. But, you don't -- we didn't anticipate, and you wouldn't anticipate, to see the same type of uptake that you would in a later line of therapy. You really need to look at this as more of a chronic type of therapy with a chronic uptake ramp.But what we've seen today, in terms of that provider and patient receptivity and uptake, we have been very pleased with for Erleada. And we're also looking forward to data, hopefully, coming soon, or early in 2019, in combination with Zytiga -- the ASUS data as well.Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. -- Good morning, and thank you very much for taking the questions. In no particular order, vision care up 6.2%, growing faster than the market. Could you please discuss if there was any stocking or one-time items in that? And how do you see Johnson & Johnson going forward in terms of product pipeline? If I can just continue quickly, orthopedic pricing was a little bit worse sequentially -- about 50 basis points. Is that just normal gyrations, or is there anything that we need to think about in that? And then, a follow-up to David's questions, how much do you think the lack of a robot in your orthopedic franchise is holding that back? Thank you. -- So, Ashley -- -- [Crosstalk] Thanks, Joanne. I guess I'll start with your first question related to vision. So, Chris mentioned the performance in vision, and it really continued in contact lens. It's the 13th quarter that we've outperformed the market. Underlying growth in contact lens remains around 7% -- very consistent with the first half. I don't expect -- to Chris' earlier point -- a lot of additional selling days or any unique stocking events in Q3. As it relates to the pipeline, I think that they have a healthy cadence. We mentioned the global rollout of Oasys 1-Day for astigmatism. We are preparing for the light management launch of a contact lens which automatically adjusts from outdoor light to indoor light. And also, preparing within the next 24 months for our allergy lens.So, I think there's a healthy cadence there in vision. I believe your question on orthopedics -- if you could repeat, Joanne, your question on orthopedics? -- Of course. And thank you for taking my speed questions. It looks like pricing is about 50 basis points worse across the board this quarter versus last quarter and I just didn't know if I should read anything into that. -- No, I think what we referenced earlier with Chris is that spine is a little bit softer than some of the other joint businesses. Hips and knees are pretty consistent at the 2-3%, and we don't anticipate significant shifts in upcoming quarters. I do think it's good news that our orthopedics business -- I would use the work stabilized -- in quarter three. And the mix improved with hips performing up 2.4%. We had our craniomaxillofacial growing 2.4%. You heard Chris mention that our knees were up one point, and that spine continued to improve versus prior quarters. Spine was down around 7.5% in quarter one. It was down about 3.2 in quarter two, and down about 1.4 in quarter three. So, clearly, progress -- but there's still work to be done in orthopedics.And I believe your last question was related to robots. And I guess what I would offer is, we have the good fortune to enjoy very strong market leading positions in open surgery, which is about 50% of all surgeries that are conducted, as well as minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery. And we intend to have offerings in digital surgery as well as offerings in endoluminal surgery. And we really think that having contribution in all four of those segments will enable a future of surgery that J&J can really add a lot of value. So, clearly, robotics are having an impact in today's market. The penetrations are still low, although growing. And I envision Johnson & Johnson to have a very competitive offering in the foreseeable future related to digital surgery. -- Thank you so much.Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners. Please start with your question. -- Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess this question is for Ashley. I just wanted to follow-up on a comment you made earlier regarding transformative M&A. Just curious what you would define as transformative M&A within the device business. And one follow-up to that -- obviously, transformative M&A would -- I mean, presumably that would be a large deal. So, in the meantime, it feels like the device business, while you guys have certainly been turning the business around, is still below market growth. You highlighted a number of drivers as it relates to new product launches.But, it feels like it's going a little bit slower than maybe some people would expect. Are there smaller tuck-in deals that can be done between now and any sort of transformative deal that could accelerate you guys back to in line with market growth? Thank you so much. -- Joe, I'll turn to you first and then I'm happy to compliment with some commentary. -- Sure. So, thanks for the question, Danielle. With respect to transformative deals, or tuck-in deals, again, we look at off scale deals. Last year along, in medical devices, we invested slightly over $1 billion with 30 tuck-in deals. And you're seeing some of that improve the performance within the medical device segment right now. So, again, it's going to come back to those core principles of making sure it's a strategic fit and then creating value for shareholders. -- And I would just compliment that Danielle was just saying -- again, historically 50% of our innovation has come from inorganic versus organic. And that blend will continue as Joe mentioned. Even in 2018, we've already done 26 deals. Some of those acquisitions, some of those equity, some of those copromote -- so, it really has to do with the strategic fit and the value creation in each of the platforms that we compete in. -- Thank you very much.Your next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. -- Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple quickies. First, on devices -- maybe for Ashley -- the 23% growth in Biosense Webster is a notable step up. You mentioned contribution from new products, but you also talked about strong procedure growth. So, I'm just wondering, have you seen any pickup in market growth from the CABANA results last spring? -- Thank you, Jayson. Yeah, we did enjoy 23% growth in quarter three. I think it's been a very strong combination of market procedures continuing to increase as well a very strong focus on commercial execution and market creation on ablation -- as well as very balanced geographic growth. We enjoyed, in our Biosense Webster business, growth of 34% in Asia, and 11% in EMEA, as well as 20% in North America. Again, combination of core performance as well as some of the new products taking effect. -- Thank you. And -- -- [Crosstalk] And the CABANA data, I would say that's -- it maybe had a slight impact in terms of overall procedural market growth, but nothing that the team called out as a significant driver. -- Okay. So, there's clearly some share capture here in your view? -- Next question, please?Yes, sorry. The next question comes from Amit Hazan with Citi. -- Thanks. Hey, good morning, guys. Just maybe start with the utilization stats that you guys give. The U.S. surgical procedures are now up for a second straight quarter in a row after, I think, seven straight down quarters. So, I'm just wondering if you guys could take a stab at trying to explain what might be happening with underlying surgical procedures in the U.S.? -- Thanks, Amit. I think -- -- [Crosstalk] I think we -- -- Go ahead, Ashley. -- Go ahead, Joe. -- So, Amit, I think when we look at a strong economy across the globe -- where is really where our strength has been -- if you look, we're actually growing outside the U.S. stronger -- two times what we've grown here in the U.S. But a strong economy does tend to lend itself to better coverage and better healthcare, so that is helping underpin some of the procedural growth that we're seeing. -- Okay. And then, specifically though, with regard to your surgery business, the U.S. Advanced piece -- in the U.S., there was obviously a good number this quarter. But, you're actually still trending at about 2% growth for the year versus about 6% for the past few years. Maybe just some color for you guys on why you're having slower growth in Advanced this year? And it's a similar trend in U.S. General as well. -- I think, Amit -- this is Ashley speaking. A couple things -- one, in our Echalon surgical business, clearly we enjoy many market leading positions. And, I'll come back to the mix. What I'm pleased to see is that our endocutter business is up 10% in quarter three. Our biosurgery at 9% -- consistent growth in our wound closure, where we enjoy market leading, really driven by some innovation on barb sutures. And a lot of evidence generation strategy related to the antimicrobial effect for infection reduction. We are seeing challenges, clearly, in reprocessing and robotics -- in some of our energy and endomechanical business.OUS, our Ener-G business, is performing quite well. But we are experiencing some challenges in the U.S. related to robotics and some reprocessing. I do expect that, when the advancement of our robotic offering in digital surgery in the forthcoming years, it will help ameliorate that. We've also dialed up the innovation agenda, and our endomechanical and Ener-G business to stronger compete in the handheld market. -- Thanks very much, Ashley.Your next question is from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse. -- Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just a couple -- maybe just one to follow-up on some of the comments around drug pricing. There's -- we've seen a lot from the administration -- yesterday, the proposal came out around needing to include pricing in some of the TV ads. And I'm just curious if maybe you can provide your perspective on this issue. Just -- do you think this is something that would be useful or not useful -- and, maybe more broadly, any other broader changes -- anything that might be implemented by the administration -- things that sort of played out here over the last several months?And then, second is just on Darzalex. I appreciate the comments you made about the quarter. I'm just curious about the Maia study. I think it was previously listed as potential clinical presentation this year -- it's not on the key events slide now. And I assume you're still going to get that internally. And just -- a couple of people asking if you can clarify exactly when you expect that data and should we expect some sort of topline press release when you receive it. And then, again, maybe generally, how important that data is to that longer-term outlook for that product. Thanks. -- Sure. So, as it relates yesterday to the administration's proposal -- as well as -- hopefully, you saw as well that pharma put forward some new principles that the pharma members will be adhering to -- we really believe the patients should have access to the information that is helpful and that they can use to make the best decisions regarding their health. And so, this does include greater transparency around healthcare costs. And so, we've been a leader in transparency to date. That's why we provide information about how we price our medicines and how we invest our resources in our annual U.S. transparency report. So, we are absolutely working in partnership with pharma around pharma's announcement yesterday and what we can do on DTC pricing. This has been done in line with what we learned from customers and patients and what they think is actually going to be helpful, which is not only information on list pricing but also putting that information into the right context. So, what that actually means for them, since list price is really just a starting point.So, for patients, what is their likely out-of-pocket cost going to be? What type of financial assistance is available, in addition to information like the list price? So, we're going to respond to the agency's proposal. There's 60 days -- we're going to go ahead and respond to that and provide our input. In the meantime, go ahead and implement what we're executing and doing in line with pharma on that. Again, I think anything that is helpful and useful to patients, and helps put all the information in context, is going to be really good for them. I think we just need to be careful of things such as list price alone -- is not the full extent of the information, and we would worry about patients not going to their doctor to seek care, not going in for their appropriate treatments.So, we believe we're doing the right thing with the pharma proposal, and we'll just have to wait and see what happens with Secretary Azar's proposal that he announced yesterday. -- Yes, regarding Darzalex, it's a 2019 filing. It's event driven, so that's all we're sharing at this point in time. -- And we're very optimistic about that data and we think it'll be an important further catalyst for Darzalex, is that data will be the regimen that is most commonly used in the United States. So, we already have that frontline data in use with Velcade ex-U.S. as well as approved in the U.S. We think the data including REVLIMID is going to be really important going forward for the U.S. market. -- Okay. Thanks so much.Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.--  Oh, thank you very much and good morning. Joe, if OK, I wanted to ask a quick question on emerging markets. Obviously, emerging markets have been in the press quite a bit lately, both in terms of the volatility of currency and emerging market economy. So, I'm just curious -- can you give us a sense, in your third calendar quarter, what happened to your businesses in emerging markets -- maybe some flavor by division, if OK, just in terms of did anything really change in terms of underlying demand or the growth rates that you achieved in emerging markets in your three big divisions? Thank you. -- Yeah, thanks for the question, Bob. So, in our emerging markets, we saw very healthy growth. In total it's about -- on an operational basis, almost 13%. And it was pretty uniform across the board. I would say BRC specifically was very strong with 15% or better growth in Brazil, Russia, and China. Maybe I can turn it over to Jorge, because we did see some particular strength out of our consumer business. And maybe just talk about the consumer results at large in the third quarter. Obviously, that was a significant step change for us, performing what we believe is going to be twice the market. Jorge, maybe if you could share a few of those thoughts? -- Sure. Thanks, Joe. Yes, we feel very good about our results in the third quarter, growing overall north of 6% organically. And, as Joe mentioned, the emerging markets were a contributor to this growing above 10% across the key geographies. Particularly, we saw a very strong performance in the BRC markets, and we continue to expect that, over time, the emerging world will continue to grow at twice the rate of our overall business at a global level. Underpinning our performance was a significant improvement in our Baby care business. We're very pleased with the early results coming out of our restage here in the United States. As Joe mentioned, we're now going to roll that out across the world, starting with India and China. And we expect to complete the global rollout across the emerging world into 2019.So, we are -- despite the occasional volatility in some functional markets, I think overall we're bullish on the outlook for the emerging world as we go forward. -- Great. Thanks, Jorge.--  Yeah, that's super helpful. Maybe just, Joe, one quick follow-up on that? So, it sounds like underlying demand is very strong across the board, especially as you mention consumer. But, given the volatility in emerging market currencies, maybe qualitatively or quantitatively, as you look forward, is that a meaningful headwind to reported EPS as we look forward, given the volatility? Or is that something that's, in your mind, very manageable relative to all of the different moving pieces that are involved with the J&J income statement? -- Yeah, Bob, it's a good question. I would think it should be a manageable headwind. And obviously, it's going to depend on how much currencies fluctuate. But we're not overly tied to currencies in emerging markets, so it should be management.--  Terrific. Thanks for taking the questions. -- I just want to take a moment here, too, and follow-up maybe on Jennifer's comments with respect to Secretary Azar's proposal, and just be very clear that we support the administration's spirit of transparency and getting more information out there. I think the position of pharma right now is we want to make sure that we provide that information in a way that's meaningful and provides clarity to patients. Having list price on DTC ads could be somewhat confusing and actually act as a deterrent to good, responsible healthcare. And we just want to make sure that that doesn't play out that way. But certainly, looking to digest the proposal and put it into practice the best way possible that's meaningful for patients and the healthcare system.Your next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. -- Morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I just had a few for Jennifer -- and maybe Joe, too. To revisit the 2019 question, I know you guys haven't given a formal view. But, just given the headwinds on pharma organic growth from Zytiga and the other LOEs, if you're not above market growth does that change strategic priorities -- either your attitude toward deals or investments across different therapeutic categories? -- Yeah, so, Geoff, maybe the first thing is to clarify the question. We currently believe we are the holder of a strong patent and we plan to defend those rights. We're looking forward to the judge's decision later this month, but, as Jennifer indicated, our growth, even with Zytiga, was very strong. There are some potentially generic headwinds on the horizon. Should that, for some reason, put us below market, which is not something that other companies face given the breadth of our portfolio -- we've got 12 brands in pharmaceuticals that deliver better than $1 billion in revenue. We can absorb that. So, we're not in a situation where we're going to take a year or two off from growth and anything that's at market is probably only temporary because we've got good confidence in our pipeline going forward. -- Okay. That's helpful, Joe. And then, a few product specific questions for pharma. For Darzalex, how has the duration of therapy been tracking, and how do you guys see the refractory myeloma space evolving when you look at the self-therapies for BCMA? And then, on Xarelto, just want to get a sense for the feedback from the field following Mariner and Commander, since ESC. I'm just trying to put these data in context of the overall brand. Thanks. -- Sure. I can start off on the Xarelto piece. So, we just got approval last week for CAD and PAD, and the team is actually out launching it as we speak. So, product is in the market and the teams are out in the market, launching and bringing Xarelto in the 2.5 milligram dose to patients. And so, we're really excited about the opportunity to expand Xarelto as the first Factor Xa inhibitor in the CAD/PAD space, which expands the opportunity by, I think, 13 million additional patients in the U.S. alone. And the data is quite striking in that indication -- 24% reduction in CV death, stroke, and heart attack. So, we're very optimistic about this launch for Xarelto.As it relates to Mariner and the data that we have across the medically ill space, we are working with the agency on that and do believe that there's a good path forward in that space for Xarelto. So, probably can't say any more than that on that right now, but we will be continuing to pursue that with the FDA going forward. So, we believe there's good reasons for future growth in Xarelto as well as continued growth in share gains in both invasive and DVT prevention and treatment space.And the other question was on -- -- [Crosstalk] Around Darzalex and CAR-T -- and how that might play together. -- Yeah, so we actually think that they're complimentary in the multiple myeloma space. And so, we're very excited about CAR-T. We've dosed our first patient already, which is a very, very fast timeline versus when we did that deal with Legend. I think, if you take a look at the unmet medical need in multiple myeloma it still remains significant need. So, I think having both Darzalex as well as what we've got with the BCMA CAR-T, together will be a nice portfolio for patients, which will allow us to continue to grow. -- Okay, great. Thank you. -- So, great. So, that concludes today's Q&A portion. Thanks to everyone who asked a question today and apologies to those who we could not get to due to time. Please don't hesitate to reach out to the investor relations team as is needed with any follow-ups. I'll now turn the call back to Joe for some closing remarks. -- Great. Thanks, Chris. Thank you, Ashley, Jorge, and Jennifer for sharing your insights on our business and delivering with your teams very strong results for the third quarter. I hope it's clear to you and the investment community that our business is very strong and we look forward to living into the new guidance that we have articulated earlier today for 2018. Thanks for interest in Johnson & Johnson, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a good day....Thank you. This concludes today's Johnson & Johnson Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  -- --  --  --  --  -- --   --  --  --  --  -- "
Why GoPro Faces an Uphill Battle,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 5:35PM
            
            ","From time to time, it seems like From time to time, it seems like   is on the cusp of escaping its current rut without ever quite breaking out. New products spur excitement every once in a while, and earnings seem to . At the end of the day, GoPro needs a lot to go right to see a long-term recovery. Given the current trajectory of its product lineup, it's unlikely we'll see a big improvement in key metrics anytime soon. To turn around net losses, GoPro needs to increase total gross profit from core products, which needs to cover operating costs and other expenses. The company can do this by increasing sales volume, raising prices, and/or cutting unit costs. None of these initiatives seem to be going particularly well right now.  We've learned in the past few years that unit sales aren't increasing -- they're actually falling. Unit sales . Volumes have leveled off recently and may be growing ever so slightly with shipments up 1.7% in the first half of 2018 to 1.82 million units, but investors have little to pin their hope to at the moment. On the pricing front, GoPro has backed down from premium pricing, choosing to go with a ""good, better, best model"" with price points of $199, $299, and $399. Incidentally, that's the same price point GoPro's lineup had in 2012. Clearly, there's little to no wiggle room for the company to raise prices.As for costs, GoPro hasn't shown significant progress on increasing margins in three years, which tells me it isn't having much success in cutting production costs. The chart below tells investors everything they need to know about sale prices and unit cost trends. Data by .GoPro's management expects gross margin to improve in 2018, peaking at around 40% in the key fourth quarter, but full-year gross margin will be in the mid-30s, which is still well below highs in 2015. Margins are getting better, but remember that volume is down significantly as well, so total gross profit will be down. That's ultimately what covers operating costs and drives profitability.Given the expected operating expenses of about $400 million this year, a 35% gross margin would require $1.15 billion in sales to break even, which is exactly what GoPro has generated in the past year. That's barely breakeven, and GAAP net profits are at least a few years away.Another way GoPro could improve profits is by growing into new markets by . But when it's tried to do that, it's failed. The Karma drone was a flop and has been discontinued from the lineup. The spherical camera Fusion is a market leader but has a very small addressable market until virtual reality headset sales grow. It's not likely GoPro will be expanding into more adjacent markets in the next year, particularly now that we've passed the key holiday launch cycle. Not having new products will make it tough to recover financially and will put more pressure on the core Hero 7 lineup. GoPro has become a one-trick pony with a successful action camera and little else to hang its hat on. But the Hero lineup seems to be in a structural decline, and GoPro hasn't been able to find a growth product to replace it with. Recovery is an uphill battle, and investors should adjust their expectations to reflect the challenges ahead."
The Clock Is Ticking on New Age Beverages Stock,"

            ","   is making the most of what it hopes will be more than just its 15 minutes of fame. Shares of the functional beverages distributor opened 5% higher on Tuesday after putting out a press release  at last week's North American Convenience Store show, but the intraday gains were gone a few minutes later. New Age Beverages was the second most visited and searched booth at the show among its 1,259 exhibitors, beating out the industry's beverage giants and leading consumer brands. The beverage upstart is generating a lot of buzz for its upcoming line of sparkling water, ready-to-drink tea, and shot products infused with cannabidiol, a cannabis component known better as CBD. New Age Beverages was able to generate attention on the trade show floor for its existing product line, even as the actual rollout of its CBD-propelled beverages took place off-site, at the hotel connected to the convention center.New Age Beverages hopes to start getting its CBD-infused products on store shelves by the end of this quarter, aiming for even larger outlets in the springtime of next year. We still need the final U.S. Farm Bill to pass with pro-CBD tenets in place later this year for things to reach a frenzied pitch, but as I argued last week, New Age Beverages is . All of the attention that New Age Beverages is generating is drawing attention to its existing portfolio. Folks visiting the New Age Beverages booth last week for a sneak peek at the CBD line that was being introduced just outside of the trade floor got an eyeful of its niche brands that are already on the market. Exposure matters, and New Age Beverages is getting plenty of it from investors, consumers, and the retailers (last week) that it will need to expand its retail footprint. This is the shot that New Age Beverages needed, with or without its CBD-infused drinks. The distributor rang up just $52.2 million in revenue last year, and sales were inching slightly lower through the first half of 2018. If sales turn around during the latter half of the year, it will be hard to deny the positive impact that the company's headlines have had on the heightened interest.The ""swing for the fences"" here will naturally require CBD beverages to clear the hurdles for the legal sale across most, if not all, of the country. There will be a glut of companies pushing CBD-spiked products in that scenario, but it will obviously be incremental for New Age Beverages.The plan for now -- if the Farm Bill passes with cannabis farming tenets in place -- is to expand the reach of the three products New Age Beverages introduced last week in March or April of next year. An interesting wrinkle is that it also will put out CBD-fused variants of its existing product lines, giving New Age Beverages the benefit of a hot trend on a product that already commands some degree of shelf space. The attention won't last forever, though, so New Age Beverages needs to strike while its name still is hot."
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 3:07PM
            
            ","    Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call, Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, October 16, 2018. Thank you.Ms. Miner, you may begin your conference. -- Good morning. This is Heather Kennedy Miner, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2017.I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to the impact of tax legislation, expenses, our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets, total assets, global core liquid assets, supplementary leverage ratio, and stress capital buffer. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that's posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website www.gs.com. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.Today on the call, I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Marty Chavez; and our incoming CFO, Stephen Scherr. As Stephen is new to many of you, I'd like to take a moment to introduce him. A 25-year veteran at Goldman Sachs, Stephen has held numerous leadership positions beginning his career in Investment Banking and then on to Fixed Income, next heading our Financing Group, Investment Banking, and later serving as our Head of Firmwide Strategy. Most recently, he was CEO of GS Bank and ran our Consumer & Commercial Banking Division including Markets.With that, I'll pass the call to Stephen. -- Thanks, Heather, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us this morning, I'd like to make a few comments before I turn the call over to Marty to walk through our third quarter results. First, let me begin by saying it's truly my pleasure to be here today as I take on my new responsibilities as CFO. I'm excited about delivering on the core job itself and getting to know all of you in the weeks and months ahead. I must also say that I'm thrilled to be part of the firm's new leadership team. David, John, and I have worked together for nearly 20 years. We know each other well, see each other as partners in the business, and share common objectives and goals for the firm. We jointly recognize the strength and importance of our client franchise, our people, and our financial capital. And I'm sure this is of particular importance to you, we intend to take a long-term view to driving strong shareholder returns. This is a key focus area for David and for the rest of the management team.With that said, let me briefly turn to two of our key priorities, which are among several areas we will cover in greater detail in the coming months. First, we believe that Goldman Sachs has among the strongest client franchises on the street with corporations, with governments and institutions, and with a growing number of individual clients and customers across the wealth spectrum. But we also know that we can do more to deliver the whole of Goldman Sachs to our clients in a more seamless way. This is a key objective. We've already begun to reexamine ways to deepen our client relationships by fostering easier access to all of Goldman Sachs. We also plan to continue to expand our reach to new clients of the firm. We will do so by better leveraging our core competencies of advice, risk management, and technology solutions; and by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship within the firm.Importantly, we remain committed to executing on the revenue growth opportunities we laid out for you about a year ago. I will provide an update on these efforts in November. Second, we are reviewing all of our businesses front to back to ensure that our people and our financial resources are optimally deployed. Our objective here is clear, to improve shareholder returns. This is why, David, John, and I along with the rest of the leadership team will look for new ways to grow our businesses while improving our operating efficiency for the long term. We expect to continue this dialog with you focusing not only on further defining our business priorities, but also on the metrics we will use to measure our progress. As we move ahead, we anticipate that we will have active and ongoing discussions with all of you. David will join our earnings call in January and is looking forward to being a participant in the quarters and years ahead.Finally, I would like to thank Marty for his many contributions to the firm as our CFO. We are fortunate that we will continue to benefit from his leadership in our Securities business. Adding Marty's deep understanding of technology and the firm's balance sheet to Ashok's market expertise and Jim's thorough knowledge of our client needs gives us the right mix of talent to lead the Securities Division. On a personal note, I'm thankful to Marty for his partnership and guidance in ensuring a smooth transition.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marty, who will walk us through third quarter results. Marty? -- Thank you, Stephen. I'd want to share that I've really enjoyed the opportunity to work with all of you, our analysts and our shareholders, during my tenure as CFO. I'm also incredibly excited to take on a new leadership role in the Securities Division where I can serve our clients and further the firm's leadership in market structure, innovation, and automation. And I look forward to spending time with the investor community in my new role. I'll now walk you through our third quarter and year-to-date results, then cover each of our businesses, and of course we'll be happy to answer any questions.Third quarter net revenues were $8.6 billion, net earnings were $2.5 billion, earnings per share was $6.28, return on common equity was 13.1%, and return on tangible common equity was 13.8%. Turning to year-to-date results. We had firmwide net revenues of $28.1 billion, the highest in eight years; net earnings of $7.9 billion and earnings per diluted share of $19.21 was a record for the first nine months. We grew year-to-date revenues by 16% or $3.8 billion and we delivered positive operating leverage, growing pre-tax earnings by 22%. Year-to-date return on common equity was 13.7% and return on tangible common equity was 14.6%, up by 340 basis points and 370 basis points respectively versus last year. Our year-to-date revenue growth demonstrates solid progress across the firm as all four of our business segments grew at a double-digit pace.We grew our Institutional Client Services revenues by 16% or $1.5 billion, accounting for 40% of the year-to-date revenue improvement. That reflects an 18% rebound in FICC and a 15% increase in equities where we continue to work to deepen our existing relationships and expand our client franchise. During the third quarter while we saw quieter levels of client activity in certain businesses, several positive macro trends continued including healthy global economic growth particularly in the US, strong CEO confidence, open financing markets, rising equity market valuations, and stable credit spread. Despite the seasonal decline in client activity amid emerging market volatility and trade policy uncertainty, we saw improvement in September as our clients continue to seek our market making services. While it's impossible to predict the future, we remain cautiously optimistic given active client dialogs, healthy economic growth, and resilient investor sentiment.Let's review individual business performance for the third quarter. Investment Banking produced net revenues of $2 billion, down 3% versus the second quarter, but up 10% versus a year ago driven by a rebound in equity underwriting. Financial Advisory revenues were $916 million, up 14% relative to the second quarter reflecting solid M&A volumes. During the quarter, we participated in announced transactions totaling over $200 billion across more than 90 deals. Our announced volumes continued to outpace the industry increasing 19% versus a year ago. Client engagement has improved notably across the Americas and Europe this year. Healthy dialogs on strategic activity continue across a broad base of sectors, including TMT, natural resources, and healthcare as well some sponsor related transactions. For the year-to-date, we ranked first in announced M&A advising on over $1 trillion of volumes across 300 transactions with a $125 billion lead over the Number 2 competitor.Moving to Underwriting. Third quarter net revenues were $1.1 billion, down 14% versus the second quarter on seasonably lower volumes, but up 20% versus a year ago. Equity underwriting net revenues of $432 million decreased 12% sequentially amid lower follow-on volumes, but more than doubled versus a year ago as IPO activity accelerated supported by strong activity in Asia. For the year-to-date, we ranked Number 1 globally in equity and equity-related underwriting with over $55 billion of deal volume across 300 transactions. We also ranked Number 1 in global IPOs. Debt underwriting net revenues were $632 million, down 16% from last quarter amid lower industry volumes. However, our year-to-date performance was a record reflecting strong client engagement and our multi-year investment in our acquisition finance business. Our Investment Banking backlog remains at robust levels, but decreased versus a record second quarter driven by M&A completions and underwriting.Our backlog still remains up significantly from a year ago. Clarity from US tax reform, a supportive economic backdrop, solid equity market valuations, significant private sponsor interest, as well as corporate desire for strategic M&A across sectors are all supporting healthy activity. Moving to Institutional Client Services. Third quarter net revenues were $3.1 billion, down 13% sequentially, but roughly flat versus last year. FICC Client Execution net revenues were $1.3 billion, down 22% sequentially and 10% lower than a year ago driven primarily by low levels of volatility and client activity. Importantly, we continue to execute on our efforts to deepen and broaden our client relationships. We also are making significant investments in our capabilities and platforms to provide content, execution, data, and analysis in modern digital format. These efforts cover the entire client experience. On the execution side, we continue to generate strong growth.Our electronic FX volumes are up over 20% year-over-year. We now have over 2,000 active FX users on our marquee single dealer platform and are in the process of launching the next generation in the fourth quarter to better serve both institutions and corporate clients. In credit, we also continued to have success with our electronic corporate bond offering. Our credit algorithm now covers 10,000 US investment grade bonds executing trades up to $2 million, allowing us to gain efficiency by electronically serving a significant portion of our investment-grade flow. Within that execution mandate, the GS corporate bond algorithm currently ranked Number 1 in US investment grade volumes on the two largest electronic platforms. Turning to the individual FICC business performance in the third quarter. Currencies increased versus a year ago in both G-10 and emerging markets driven by higher activity and better performance.Commodities also increased versus the more challenged performance a year ago helped by lack of headwinds in natural gas and power. Offsetting these improvements, rates declined significantly year-over-year amid low volatility and lower activity across government and inflation products, particularly in Europe. Credit declined amid sluggish activity across products and the smaller opportunity set. Lastly, mortgages declined versus last year primarily on lower performance and volumes in CMBX. Turning to Equities, net revenues for the third quarter were $1.8 billion, down 5% sequentially; but up 8% versus a year ago on better performance, higher US equity market volumes, and higher average volatility. Equities client execution net revenues of $681 million were roughly flat sequentially and up 17% versus a year ago. Performance was supported by strength in our derivatives businesses, partially offset by lower cash revenues from program and on exchange electronic trading.Commissions and fees of $674 million were down 12% sequentially, but roughly flat versus a year ago. Nonetheless, we continue to see strength and market share growth in our low touch volumes with meaningful year-over-year gains in all regions. Security Services net revenues of $439 million were flat sequentially and rose 9% versus last year reflecting higher average client balances as we continue to invest to expand our footprint in the business. Moving to Investing & Lending, collectively, these activities produced net revenues of $1.9 billion in the third quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.1 billion reflecting net gains from private investments, primarily driven by improved corporate performance. Mark-to-market on public securities reflected lower performance in Asia. On a year-to-date basis, our Equities I&L businesses generated $3.5 billion of net revenues, roughly 60% from corporate investments and 40% from real estate.Our global private and public equity portfolio consists of over 1,000 different investments and remains diversified across industry and geography and balanced across investment vintage. We continue to reinvest to drive future long-term performance with 46% of the investments in the portfolio made in the last four years. The remaining 54% is split with 23% from investments made between 2012 to 2014 and with 31% made in 2011 or earlier, which are generally closer to harvesting. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $750 million. Results included approximately $700 million of net interest income, equivalent to a $2.8 billion annual pace. Our net interest income continues to grow as we increase more recurring revenue streams and lend more to our broad client base. Results this quarter also included a provision for loan losses of $174 million, primarily related to loan growth.Our I&L assets included approximately $105 billion in loans, debt securities, and other assets and $21 billion in equity investments. In addition, we hold another $12 billion of consolidated real estate investments on the balance sheet. Let me also give you a quick update on our Marcus consumer business. Marcus has evolved from a single product to a multi-product platform and today serves more than 2 million customers through our lending and savings products and our personal financial management app, Clarity Money. We were pleased to launch our fourth business late last month entering the UK retail deposit market. Since launch through last Friday, we have raised nearly $2 billion of UK online deposit across more than 55,000 accounts. In addition, our US retail deposits grew to over $26 billion at quarter end as we continue to expand and diversify our sources of funding.In our Marcus personal loans business, we held $4 billion of loans on our balance sheet at quarter end. We continue to monitor credit quality closely and remain very aware of where we are in the credit cycle. Our pace of loan growth will continue to be governed by our assessment of consumers' ability to pay and the overall macro environment. We are building this business for the long run and we are not chasing volume targets. We will continue to grow deliberately and carefully. Next, turning to Investment Management. We posted net revenues of $1.7 billion in the third quarter driven by continued growth in our asset management and private wealth businesses. Net revenues were down 8% sequentially driven by significantly lower incentive fees, but up 12% versus a year ago on higher management and other fees and incentive fees. Management and other fees were $1.4 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 9% versus a year ago.Transaction revenues were $174 million, down 4% versus the second quarter and up 4% versus last year. Assets under supervision finished the quarter at a record $1.55 trillion, up $37 billion versus the second quarter. Results included $13 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter with inflows across all major categories with particular strength in equities in quantitative solutions. In addition, we saw $8 billion of net inflows into liquidity products and $16 billion of market appreciation. Over the trailing five years, we attracted total cumulative organic long-term net inflows of approximately $225 billion. Now let's turn to expenses. We continue to monitor and manage our expense base carefully. We emphasize paying for performance to attract and retain the best talent and investment spending to support our clients while building technology, infrastructure, and platforms to grow the firm for the future.Compensation and benefits expense include salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior equity awards, and other items such as benefits. We reduced our year-to-date compensation to net revenues ratio to 38%, down 200 basis points from the first nine months of last year reflecting our strong year-to-date revenue growth and our emphasis on profitability. Non-compensation expenses year-to-date were $7.6 billion, up 17 % or $1.1 billion versus a year ago. Roughly 55% of the increase versus last year continued to be from expenses related to client activity and investments for growth, including approximately $425 million across Marcus, our consolidated investments, and technology; and approximately $190 million from higher brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees. We also saw roughly $215 million of expense increase related to the new accounting standard and a $149 million increase in litigation expense.On taxes, our year-to-date tax rate was 19%. We expect our full-year 2018 tax rate to be materially consistent with the first nine months. This rate can vary and is based on a number of factors, including our overall level and mix of earnings and updated guidance from Treasury on the implementation of tax legislation. As we said previously, we will provide updates on our tax rate for future years once we have final guidance from Treasury expected this quarter. Turning to balance sheet, liquidity, and capital. Our global core liquid assets averaged $238 billion during the quarter, roughly unchanged from second quarter. We continue to expect this to decline as we redeploy our balance sheet to meet client needs. Our balance sheet was $958 billion, roughly flat versus the second quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 13.1% using the standardized approach and 12.4% under the Basel III advanced approach.Our ratios improved by 50 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively, on a sequential basis. Overall, 40 basis points of the improvement was driven by an increase in common shareholders' equity and reduced market RWAs. The advanced ratio further improved, primarily on credit RWA reductions. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 6%, up 20 basis points versus the second quarter. On capital return, we paid $311 million in common stock dividends and bought back $1.24 billion in the quarter, in line with our $5 billion share repurchase authorization for the 2018 CCAR cycle. And over the past three quarters, we have now built back our standardized CET 1 ratio by 120 basis points, in line with our ratio before tax reform took effect. We have a strong capital position to both serve clients and invest for growth.Before taking questions, a few closing thoughts. We are pleased with our performance in the first nine months of 2018, which include our self-funded investments for future organic growth. Our solid double-digit year-to-date revenue increase demonstrates the capabilities in each of our client businesses and we continue to work hard to grow further from here. We also remain committed to driving positive operating leverage as revenues grow, which was clearly on display as pre-tax earnings are up 22 % driving our year-to-date ROTE of 14.6%. In addition, our strong competitive position and continued execution enable us to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders.With that, thank you again for dialing in and we'll now open up the line for questions.(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. -- Hi, thanks. Follow up on your dialogue around Marcus and the provision in I&L. So, I hear today that most of it's related to growth. I'm curious at some point are we going to see some of it related to seasoning as you grow and time goes on. And I think there was a story during the quarter that you pulled back maybe 10% versus your growth expectations. Are you seeing any signs of stress or delinquencies? Is that just prudent risk management? -- Sure. Thanks, Glenn. It's Stephen, I'll take that question. First, In terms of the pace of activity in Marcus. We have been underwriting and reunderwriting this business from the first quarter, we began in the fourth quarter of '16, and at each moment taking stock of where we are mindful of being potentially late in the consumer cycle. And so, we have honed our underwriting standards and have watched where our vintages come in. Debate around '19, which the press paid some attention to, is really about the level and pace of growth. In '19 I'm confident that we'll see an increase in originations relative to where we are in '18. The debate is about the pace and size of that increase and the decision we're going to make is entirely based on what we see in the portfolio, particularly as our vintages start to illustrate where we are, but equally mindful of where we are in the consumer cycle.I'd say by the way on that, there's no material evidence to suggest that it's turning, but equally we take stock of just how long this cycle has gone. And so we're quite careful and '19 will be about pace of growth not whether we will grow. And the question I think you asked about reserves that we're taking, I would say that something on the order of about a third of that was in fact related to Marcus. And it's important to understand that the reserve build around Marcus will be commensurate with growth. Meaning as we take growth up and you're in that growth cycle, you're going to take more reserves and at some point, you'll hit a level of stability where your reserves will in fact level off because you've leveled off in terms of a static position in terms of loans on the book. But I think that right now, that's simply a function of the growth trajectory of the business from beginning to where we are. -- Okay. I appreciate all that. And then one follow-up on comp. Revs are up 16% year-to-date, you commented about your year-to-date ratio at 38% is down 200 basis points versus last year. Can't predict anything. But if the fourth quarter's somewhere in the range of in line with year-to-date trends, is it crazy to think we might see a much lower comp ratio versus last year meaning in that same 100 basis points to 200 basis points lower for full year? -- Glenn, this is Marty. On the comp ratio, as you know, it's -- we see it as an output not an input, important that we attract talent and retain talent and we'll continue to do that. The ratio that you see now 38%; which is down 2 points from the first nine months of last year, down 1 point from where we had it in the first half of this year; is as you would expect our best estimate of the comp ratio with all the information that we have right now. And where the full-year ratio ends up will depend on what happens in the fourth quarter, which we won't predict. One other thought, we have mentioned this in the past, but I think it's important. As we expand the firm and grow our businesses and we emphasize lending and also platforms, increasingly our focus is turning away from comp to net revenue ratio where -- which has historically been a topic on these calls, and really to efficiency ratio overall where we're looking at comp and non-comp expenses holistically with the focus on profitability. -- Fair, OK. An accounting follow-up or just a geography thing. The $160 million tender gain, it was across both I&L and FICC and Equities. Do you have that breakout just so we could do our little sustainability numbers on what grew where? -- Sure. Glenn, I'd be happy to break that down. So as you noted, it's $160 million in revenue on the debt tender and the geography in our financial statement is approximately evenly split across FICC ICS, Equities ICS, and I&L.So, approximately evenly split across those three categories.Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead. -- Hello, Michael. -- Good morning. First one, just on the Investment Banking and the trading backdrop. Some of your competitors mentioned that the competitive dynamics have gotten a little bit more intense more recently. Just wanted to get your take on what you guys are seeing, some of the -- maybe the market share opportunities that you set out over a year ago. How that's playing out and how much of that is from like a competitive standpoint versus maybe some of the technology initiatives that you guys have been investing in that maybe you guys have more of a competitive advantage than some others? -- Well, Michael, I'll start with Investment Banking. We have, as you can see in the results, a leading position and we continue to emphasize that and build on that. That position already at the top of the league tables is one that is an important part of our growth initiatives. So for instance, we have targeted 1,000 new clients and we've assigned coverage on 80% of those and we've done that with many new hires, which you've seen in the news, and that's starting to play through in revenues. Going to FICC and Equities, those businesses as we all know are always competitive and there we have a historical strength in our platforms. We've had our SecDB risk management platform for decades and that is the differentiating part of our expertise in risk management.And we're leading in those extremely competitive businesses with content, scale, and making it all client centric and investing to modernize it with digital access, digital formats of many kinds, digital user experiences over the web, same tools that our people use deploying them to clients; also giving clients the abilities to plug in directly into our platform through APIs, which is very much a theme for us as well as all companies that are building and deploying technology for their clients. And we've started to see that again also play through in revenues. We've highlighted in the past our investment in a platform expansion to serve quant clients tailored for them, but also a value to our traditional clients. And we've seen since 2016 about 180 basis points market share growth in low touch and half of that in the year-to-date. -- Okay. That's helpful. And then just one on the I&L outlook and backdrop. I think when we see more volatility in the market, sometimes that weighs on you guys and maybe the visibility on that business. Just given what you guys have done to build out the Investing and Lending business and the makeup today, just how much will the public market volatility, maybe wider credit spreads impact it versus sort of the core lending growth and then maybe on the equity side like if GDP growth continues to be healthy? I guess just some perspective on different backdrops and how that can impact that business given that it's a little bit tougher to gauge? -- Absolutely. So I'll start by saying and it's a theme that we've discussed before, which is that these businesses are not market beta businesses. They're franchise adjacent. They are part of our franchise, both the equity and the debt part of I&L So, I'll just start with the equity part. There's two contributors; first of all, the merchant banking division and also our Special Situations Group. Starting with merchant banking. The portfolio is diversified across sector, across geography, across private equity, and real estate. We have a sourcing and origination model that's distinctive, doesn't exist elsewhere; it's strongly connected to our IBD platform, to our institutional relationships with corporates, with private equity firms.And in addition, we're leveraging our GS domain expertise and knowledge to make the investment decision. And in all of these platforms, we have a diversified lending portfolio that's got a differentiated sourcing mechanism with a long history of strongest contested returns. And so, the drivers of that are going to be synergies with the rest of our platform and the differentiated content that we have as we make -- as we harvest these investments. And so, I would not think of it as linked to market beta. And of course on the Equity I&L line for both private and public, it will be affected by market valuation levels, but the operating performance is really what's critical and we saw that driving the results in that segment this quarter.Your next question is from the line of Christian Bolu with Bernstein. Please go ahead. -- Good morning, Marty, and welcome to the call, Stephen. -- Thank you. -- So staying on FICC, just maybe a follow-up to the previous question. I guess if you could share just an update on the growth initiatives you guys outlined to expand the customer footprint and kind of where you are in the ability to pick up extra billion dollars of revenues over the next couple years? And then ultimately when do you think some of these initiatives to expand the footprint will start to kind of actually play out in revenues? -- So there's, as you know Christian, many things we're doing and in the growth initiatives that we outlined, we're tracking those closely and you're starting to see some of those initiatives play through in FICC specifically. There -- as we emphasized when we laid out the growth initiatives there, they're not dependent on improvement in the market environment and so their wallet share is an important metric and it's one that we're following closely and holding our people accountable. One of my colleagues who will be my Co-Head in the Securities Division when I rejoin, Jim Esposito, has been doing this in banking for years and now as Co-Head of Securities Division the same kind of granular week-by-week, quarter-by-quarter tracking of where we are with the top 1,300 institutional clients. It's just one source of third-party market data, but in the coalition data for the first half of 2018 shows that with those 1,300 institutional clients mostly representing market making a risk intermediation, we're Number 2 in FICC and Number 2 jointly across FICC and Equities and we've seen 30 basis points expansion in the wallet share since the end of 2016 with those clients.So just to step back and look at our strategy, broadly I'll just highlight four aspects of it. First, clients. In that business as in all of our business -- businesses, it begins and ends with the clients, so clients have risks they don't want, want risks they don't have. It's our job to help them understand their risks and to get them from A to B, and to do that by providing them liquidity and doing that by providing them financing and having a seamless client experience front to back. And platforms, happy to go into it and as much detail as you'd like, that's where I'll be spending a lot of my time, it's fundamental to our success in the business. And there again, it's taking the tools that we've developed for ourselves and sharing them very broadly with clients in a variety of formats, including for many clients who want to just plug in through APIs and get our data sets and risk analytics directly and plug into their computers. Doing this all, while optimizing our resources, managing our liquidity, capital and expenses. What's exciting for me and for all of us is the world-class team that we have in that business and our success is going to be driven really entirely by how effectively we bring together engineers, salespeople, bankers, traders to deliver that content and execution. -- Great. Very comprehensive answer. Thank you. Switching over to the private bank, at least by our numbers it feels like private bank lending is significantly under-penetrated relative to peers. So curious how you think about the opportunity to expand lending and that business. And then more broadly, could you update us on maybe progress on kind of your initiatives to grow the advisor base and client assets? -- We agree and we are working on it. It's part of our growth initiatives that we outlined and especially outside the US where we're already strong, especially outside the US we see significant opportunities and we'll be coming back to talk to you about that. We are hiring and executing on it.Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. -- Good morning. You guys had a nice increase in the capital this quarter. Obviously, it's a combination of retained earnings, but also a decline in both assets and RWAs. And just wondering how much of that is kind of explicit effort to optimize the balance sheet after CCAR and if it is is there a further optimization you can do to get better positioned for 2019 and beyond CCAR? -- Well, of course, we are pleased at the success with which we've built capital over the past three quarters. As we reviewed the standardized CET1 ratio is up 50 basis points sequentially and it's putting it now 10 basis points above the level before tax reform hit. So that's a 120 basis point build. And we've been doing this while having operating leverage investing in all of our businesses and so that's a fantastic result. It has been a focused effort across the firm. Now a large part of the improvement in the capital ratios is just performance retained earnings. On the market RWA, those have benefited and that's a part of the driver of the improvement and lower volatility. And then on our credit RWA, it's changing in composition of the loan book. So all of those effects are part of it.Stephen, would you like to add to that? -- Yes, the only thing I would add to that is I think that the speed and efficiency with which our ratios recovered over three quarters following year-end, I think speaks volumes about the agility of the business to adjust. And I know there are often questions raised about changing circumstances in regulation and capital needs. And I think that if you look at the way in which we took our ratios up as quickly as we did, frankly without negative consequence to the overall business, in fact they rose by virtue of the strength of the business. So you see capital increase by virtue of retained earnings and you look at the speed with which we turned velocity on commitments made so that commitments are not sitting on the book for an extended time. All of these are inputs and variables that I think say a lot about the business's ability to adapt. And I just -- I offer you that in the context of thinking forward to what may play out from a capital point of view and the organization's ability to adjust. -- Okay. And then, just sticking with capital, you've made a couple of comments about updating and potentially expanding the growth efforts next month. To date the vast majority of your growth initiatives have been organic. I think you had a couple of small deals below the radar. But would acquisitions be more of a part of the strategy going forward or what are the current thoughts on, call it, medium and large-sized acquisitions? And then just the level of your stock, which is obviously off quite a bit this year, does that play into the thought process as well? Thank you. -- Sure. It's Stephen. Why don't I (ph) take that question? I think that you should expect that in certain segments of our business, we will continue to be acquisitive. So in that context, acquisitions around our consumer business have been made and I think we'll continue to make them. They are immaterial in the overall size of the organization, but quite material in the context of aggregating both engineering talent and IP to develop that business more thoroughly. I think, equally in the context of the Investment Management division, historically you have seen us make small acquisitions in that context because you can pick up teams or assets or sort of extend yourself into adjacent businesses. So I think in those two areas, you should expect us to be nimble and potentially acquisitive. I think in the size of those transactions where stock stands as a currency is less relevant. Putting cash to that acquisition is perfectly reasonable and immaterial.Now, I would say that as much as we'll be acquisitive in those two areas, that's not meant to be a read across to the strategic sort of view of the firm more broadly. And so I don't want to have you come away thinking that those read across to major acquisitions that the firm would do. I simply want to point out that those are businesses where acquisitions are efficient, both as I said in the acquisitions of talent and IP and equally time to market, particularly in the consumer business where the opportunities may present themselves.Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. -- Hi. I had a couple of questions. First, as it relates to the Marcus 2020 targets for $1 billion in revenues and $14 billion in outstanding, would you say that you're pulling back from those targets, which seems to be fine if you're seeing conditions change? -- So on your question on Marcus, I would say that it's important to recognize that there are a number of different components to Marcus that contribute to the 2020 objective, unsecured lending in the Marcus platform being one but equally the value of deposits in that franchise being another. And then there may well be other opportunities that present themselves in terms of new business between now and then. And so it's a mix of different businesses. And I'd point out that even if we were to moderate growth, the growth would still be in place in lending for '19, but we were to moderate it. If you just look at the rather explosive growth in the deposit platform, particularly in the UK, so we are not two or three weeks in and have nearly $2 billion equivalent of UK deposits, the FTT value on that will be significant. I guess the point I'm making is that when you look at the loan component that makes up a number of different inputs to that target, our ambition is not to stretch, stretch to the target, meaning we're not going to let that business sort of grow because the target is out there in terms of balance sheet if in fact the market and the environment is not hospitable to it. And we will watch it carefully, but not grow against the gale wind. We don't see that win yet. So we'll continue to grow but the point being there are multiple sort of avenues by which we will hit that target in 2020. -- And then two separate questions. Stephen, you mentioned one strategy is to deliver the entire Goldman Sachs to deepen client relationships. I guess from our perspective, you guys crush it with the relationships with the CEOs of corporations, but you don't get your fair share of the business given those relationships at the top of the house. Correct me if I'm misunderstanding that. So, what metric would you look at? Like what share of wallet, say, do you have with corporations today and where would you like that to be or help me how to think about that? -- Sure. So historically in Investment Banking, which have been the principal owners of corporate relationships, you're right to point out that the relationship by and large went to the top of the house. I will tell you just from my own experience in that business that the relationships now have really broadened quite considerably over the last several years and frankly, I'd go back to the financial crisis when liquidity was dear that liquidity and capital raising for companies became strategic and moved its way into the office of the CEO. And so, the relationships that our teams have now go well beyond the CEO and extend into CFOs, treasurers, assistant treasurers in the context of what's there. I'd also say that our relevance in the context of activity with which we can engage corporates on has grown quite considerably and frankly, that's been commensurate with credit extension that we have made to a number of our clients as a general matter.And so, if you will, our petition for a broader set of business I think is more real and more credible than it's been in a long, long while. And finally, I'd say and an example of this would be the nascent plans now around corporate cash management, which is I view us as having an extraordinary set of relationships with corporates to sort of look and build that business on a technology platform that will be rather edgy and I think our ability to capture it now is more real than it would have been years ago. But equally I'd point out that when you look at the tangible addressable market that that represents relative to the traditional product sets that we have been in, it almost doubles. So just imagine when you look at the strength of the Investment Banking business and you find us in Number 1 positions across a range of different products, imagine us extending that product set now to corporate cash management and other similar such businesses and I think the opportunity there is fairly extensive growth in areas that we have not played in before.Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. -- Hello, Betsy. -- Hi, good morning. Couple of questions. Just starting off on Marcus. I think you indicated reserve build for the portfolios overall and gave us a split into Marcus and it seems like that's running at about a 7% build on new loans. I'm wondering if that's the right math and if you can talk us through how you think about reserving for Marcus. Is it on a one year forward basis, is it on a longer-term basis than that? And if you could just update us on the FICOs of the portfolio and where your new -- new loans are coming out in terms of a FICO band? -- Sure. So as I said I think in response to a question earlier, our reserve build has been commensurate with loan growth and it's not a function of any perceived deterioration in the book itself. While I don't have the specific numbers, I will tell you that we reserve at differentiated levels across the aggregate loan book such that we reserve at a higher level for Marcus loans relative to what we would be reserving on other loans and that should not come as a surprise because the Marcus loans are unsecured and we have security in a vast majority of the balance of the loan book that's there. And so, it's differentiated and tailored as it ought to be and as it's required to be based on the perceived risk that's there. And I think so long as we remain in a growth mode, you'll continue to see that increase commensurate with the growth itself. -- And that differentiation is within Marcus as well or you're just talking about between Marcus and different other loan products? -- Yes, sorry. Yes, let me be clear. It's not differentiated within Marcus itself, it's differentiated as between Marcus and other loans that sit on our books. Let me also come back to the question you asked around FICO scores. Our FICO band still skew into the 700s. Candidly, there has not been a change from the time we originated to where we are now. We trend high on the FICO band and we'll continue to sort of stay above 660 or better in the context of our forward-going underwriting in Marcus. -- Okay. And then on the UK side, you indicated what $2 billion in deposit growth over 55,000 accounts. Did I get those numbers right? -- You did. In fact the numbers have increased since the numbers we cited you on Friday. I mean those numbers now are at about 75,000 and well into $2 billion US equivalent of deposits that have been raised. And I think what's interesting is that this is now filling out the strategic intent that we had from the very beginning around retail deposits beginning in the US and now evident in the UK, which is the opportunity for us to sort of engage in retail deposit gathering as a substitution for the predominance of wholesale funding, I think holds out enormous strategic value for us. And it's now sort of playing through that way and we've been super pleased with the progress on deposits in the US and equally as you can imagine just given the pace of growth of deposits in the UK, that's proving to be a very, very valuable channel for us.Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. So, wanted to start off with a question on capital on the SCB. Stephen, it was encouraging to hear you speak about your commitment to deliver improved shareholder returns, the plans to evaluate the different businesses. And I'm just wondering given the uncertainty relating to how the stress capital buffer rules are ultimately going to unfold and the expectation for further delays beyond the next few months, how do you handicap the impact of changing roles and evaluate through the cycle returns across your different businesses? -- Well, Steven, I'll start with that and then -- and then turn it to Stephen. So on the SCB, we are a vigorous participant in the industry conversations. You've seen our bilateral letter that we filed with the Fed and we know that the Fed is listening. At the same time, we don't know the form that the final rule will take and any thoughts on when SCB will be incorporated into CCAR would just be speculation on our part so we won't do that. But I will say that as per the final form that the rule takes, we'll be prepared. Stephen referenced our agility in building capital to the level that we've got right now. We will continue to have that kind of agility and we'll be ready for SCB to be a part of CCAR 2019 and equally we'll be ready for SCB to be part of a later CCAR, in which case we'd continue to be bound by SLR. As you know, we support the underlying concept of SCB which is linking spot and stress capital. The details are really important. Stephen? -- I would only add to that that, as I said earlier, we need to run and guide the firm with customer and client centricity at its core and in doing that, of course, we're mindful of the potential for changing circumstances in capital rules and we need to be nimble in the context of how we adapt to them just as we were over the last three quarters to adapt to change occasion by tax. I would say that from the perspective of David, John, and myself; we're undertaking now a mark-to-market on the business as you would expect any new leadership team to do and in that context, we're looking to rationalize cost and make sure our costs are right front to back. But equally and to your question, capital's a scarce resource and we need to ensure that capital is being allocated appropriately to businesses that can hurdle what we care to hold out for them in the context of ways in which we can serve customers and clients. And so I would only represent to you that with capital as a scarce resource and the potential for capital rules to change and for us to stay nimble yet serve our clients, we need to go through this exercise in a very, very detailed way and then make very hard decisions about where capital ought to be deployed as in across different businesses to do what I said at the beginning is our intent and that's to yield positive shareholder return on the back of our activities. -- That's incredibly helpful color. And then just one follow-up from me on operating leverage. We saw some nice efficiency improvement in the quarter. Marty, I appreciate your color speaking to how you view expenses and managing efficiency more holistically. I'm just wondering how much of the improvement this quarter was a function of revenue mix, and then looking over the next couple of years, it feels like expectations are flat and assumption around continued revenue growth somewhere in the mid-single digit range, but really no operating leverage improvement. I was hoping you could speak to your commitment to delivering improved margins and profitability if that revenue growth materializes. -- Sure. It's Stephen. Why don't I take that with a sort of forward going look? So if you look at the three quarters, our revenues were up 16% and our expenses together were up 13%, and here I'm not distinguishing between comp or non-comp. I'm just looking at expenses overall. So a 3% delta over the three quarters, and that includes considerable expenditure in the context of growth. And so what I find positive in that and a guide toward where we will be is that we're going to look to continue to fund our growth from within the business, and all the while produce operating leverage in the business. I think that expectations ought to be modest in through the balance of this year, but equally in through '19 as we stay on a growth theme and make the kind of expenditures that Marty was referring to, which we think have positive IRR and will yield no long term -- frankly medium to long term positive return for shareholders. Longer term, I think we should hold ourselves out to even greater efficiencies because platforms will become more mature, delivery of product across all of our businesses will be more efficiently delivered, and you'll start to see pickup at the top line by virtue of the investment in the growth initiatives themselves. And so I just draw that -- I distinguish in sort of time segments without being overly precise as to what I expect to continue in the near term, and then what can happen over the longer term.Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. -- First one on the loans receivable. I think that you -- at least (ph) from the last Q about half of the loans receivable balance is in corporate exposures. So just wondering if maybe you could give some color around what types of loans those are, what portion might be tied to deals or look like levered loans, how much of those are secured. I think Marty, you spoke to the fact that you guys are approaching cyclical risk with prudence, which is clearly reassuring. Just maybe helpful to get some of those stats around the portfolio. -- Sure. I'll take you through that, happy to. So if you look at the loan book in aggregate, about 80% of it is secured. And there's many components to that loan book. Some of it is, for instance, in real estate, it's nearly 100% secured and the institutional part of that portfolio, it is also diversified. Of course, there is our relationship lending, IBD corporates, there's middle market lending, and then I'll mention a couple of other items. So the private wealth management, GS Select part of the loan book is 98% secured, and then Marcus of course is not secured. But as Stephen has described, we have an intense focus on the credit profile.Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. -- This question, I think, is going to build a little bit on some of the earlier comments that you've made on platforms and margins going forward, but I wanted to take a look at, for example, FICC which has struggled over the years and this quarter again has a significant revenue downturn. But can we go below the surface and talk a little bit about margins as that business becomes more of a platform business, more digitized? Can you give us a sense for what's been going on with the margin? Are we looking to some extent at pricing coming down as the business is more digitized, but on the other hand, the margin improving because of that? -- Well, this is one of my favorite topics. So I'm happy to go through what we're doing on platforms. There are so many themes here and they all relate to margin and scale. So it is just the way of the world of compression wherever you look, and that's driven by technology and data. And that's a trend that we're embracing, not resisting, and this is and remains a people business and at the same time, we want to give our people tools, so that they do the things that people can do best and always will do best. And then leave to machine, things that the machines do best, alright Just as I wouldn't want to compete with my HP-12C to see who can add or multiply faster. And that's a general theme.So across securities, but I'll emphasize FICC since you asked about it. We're in the middle of a large project which we've been funding organically to reengineer the legacy systems; we have them, everybody has them, to eliminate manual work and drive scale, an important theme as data becomes, and we all know this is the fuel for the economy, using that data and carefully and appropriately, hugely important in all businesses, especially in our business, to provide results that are better for the clients. We're going to continue to invest in Marquee. I mentioned the rollout that we're doing in the fourth quarter. We have a huge ambition to create cross-asset integrated agency and principal platform for accessing liquidity across all the products and making that liquidity available to our clients in a variety of formats over the voice channel, our people using those tools, clients using the tools, clients plugging into our computers directly.And so all of this is happening as that business becomes increasingly automated. We're taking many of the same themes that have been very successful for us in our equity business. I highlighted some of them in the prepared remarks. Our bond pricing engine quoting 10,000 CUSIPs. That number is only going up. The $2 million size, that number we'd expect to go up, the development of ETFs in credit is transforming that business, creating the capability for portfolio and program trading along the lines of what we've done in equities. So there is a lot of parallels to equities. Of course, the market structure is different, and these businesses will evolve differently and at different speeds, but the lessons we've learned of building tools, having a tool-driven culture, putting those tools in the hands of our people and clients, that's what's going to drive margin efficiency and scale.Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. -- Maybe just talk a little bit about the strategy in Marcus, longer term, I think you mentioned potentially adding more products. I mean, as you kind of go down, Marty, a little bit on wealth management with Ayco, how do you see this evolving? Do you see -- going -- pursuing sort of more of a retail wealth brokerage type model layered on to Marcus? It seems like brokerage should be kind of a core competency. How do you think about that, adding those kind of businesses longer term? -- Sure. So I would say we began with Marcus on a product-by-product basis in part because it was prudent execution and it was cautious and we needed to ensure that we would get it right and play it right. But our ambition was never to just be a bespoke set of products. What we want to offer out to consumers and millions of consumers is an opportunity to engage with us so as to improve their own financial engagement and the like. And to that end, we're building a platform. Clarity Money, which is an app that we acquired, can present itself as a front door where it offers consumers an ability to manage their balance sheet and their cash flow, and all the while, give them a financial wallet, off of which they can then take part in a platform that would be made up of products, some of which -- many of which will be our own; some of which may not be our own. Obviously, deposits and lending are just the two products as of now that sit on that growing and developing platform.As I look forward, there are a number of opportunities for us on the product set. One, certainly as you're referring to, is wealth and a more mass affluent wealth product. And I think that we're particularly well positioned to do that in the context of the adjacency that exists between our investment management division and Marcus, where we have an extraordinary factory floor in GSAM that can build and develop product. That product can be put on a more mass affluent wealth platform, and so I think wealth, as you allude to, is an area that we should certainly focus on.I would also say on the topic of adjacencies, and this is to make the point that as we develop a broader, bigger Marcus platform, there are adjacent channels and avenues in and around the firm that we can avail ourselves of. One, you alluded to, is Ayco. Ayco is an extraordinary channel that sits within the investment management division, and has and does present us with an opportunity to go in through the business to get to consumers. So think of B2B2C, and they have relationships with formidable companies and the ability to offer Marcus at work, just as an example, is sort of a channel that can be pursued. And so Marcus as a platform is not to be viewed as an island within the firm.I'd also say that we have opportunity by virtue of relationships that exist with corporates through investment banking, to take those relationships and look to develop partnerships with consumer-facing organizations. And frankly that will lower our cost per acquisition on customers of Marcus. And so I offer this out, not just to give you an indication of what the platform might look like, what the forward roadmap might be with respect to product, but equally to sort of let you in on the adjacencies and channels and opportunities that exist around Goldman Sachs that can serve in the growth of what we've tried to build with respect to consumers.Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. -- The first question is on the equities business and just the success you're having, and on a relative basis as well. Obviously, there was a lot of concern just heading into the year around the business, particularly with MiFID II implementation, but revenues are now up, I think, about 15% year-to-date. So you're clearly taking market share there. And so now that we've had some data to look at, can you see whether you're consolidating market share in areas that maybe MiFID is most directly impacting, so you're winning on that front? Or is it maybe growth coming from other places or mix? It's just a little bit tough on the outside to strip it out, so want to get some color on the success there. -- Sure, happy to go through that. So you're correct. Revenues year-to-date for the equity segment are up 15%, and going into the quarter, the main driver of the quarter is client activity. We also highlighted year-on-year strength on derivatives. Now over the last several years, if you look at the cash and derivatives' contribution to equities client execution, it's evenly balanced, though it can of course change from quarter-to-quarter. And as we've highlighted in previous calls, we have scale, we have depth and breadth of products across cash and derivatives, a variety of product formats, strength in prime, which goes from strength to strength and diversified regionally and we wouldn't trade that business for anyone else as we've definitively seen ourselves picking up market share, as you referenced. We see that in third-party statistics of various kinds. I talked about earlier how we've grown our wallet share in low-touch and so that is a part of the investments that we've been making.Now, you referenced MiFID II, and MiFID II is an important driver, it is not the only one, of something that's happening across the system, which is consolidation in the top three scale players. As we were preparing for MiFID II implementation on these calls and in other formats, we said that we expected the MiFID II reforms to actually benefit the scale players, those with differentiated content and execution capabilities as well as research, and we are one of those. We're investing to be certain that we continue to remain there and definitively we've seen, especially in Europe, but also globally market share concentrating in the top three.Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. -- You guys have been very cognizant of the credit cycle, you've talked about where we are relative to the consumer side. Can you remind us, in the underwriting of the Marcus loans, what are you underwriting for in terms of a peak loss rate? When we get into a down credit cycle recession, nobody knows when that will happen, but we all recognize credit losses, for everybody it will go up. Can you remind us what you think how the Marcus portfolio will perform in that environment and what the peak credit losses could be? -- So the way we have approached Marcus is that in each vintage, we price our book in order that it could incur a doubling of the modeled loss and leave us in a breakeven position obviously with the exception of whatever we had paid for the acquisition of a customer itself. So putting those expenses aside, in a loss scenario, we price for a doubling of loss, again, to put us at a breakeven. And our own thinking is not different than yours in the context of where we are. As I said at the start, there has been no manifest evidence to suggest that it is or has turned, but knowing that we're long in the cycle, we're attentive to our underwriting.I'd also point out that in the context of the six or seven quarters since we began, by virtue of what we've built from a clean technology slate, we're on to our 10th or 11th iteration of the underwriting box. And that is one in which we learn from data both on-premise and off-premise, so what we learn from our own portfolio as well as what we can glean from publicly available information, and we continue to hone our underwriting box and back-test it against prior vintages. But all the way along, we stand to our own imposed policy of ensuring that we price for doubling of loss.Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. -- I had two questions and kind of the same kind of focus, but if you look at a thousand new customers, and you're talking about attracting new sales reps and trying to expand, are we -- Goldman years ago had kind of consolidated up toward the top-end of the market. Are you thinking about going downstream more to institutional customers that are maybe middle market? And are you -- what segments are you most interested in, in that case? -- I'd answer your question without limit to any particular division, meaning, if I look at investment banking, as part of the growth initiatives with the 2020 target, we set out to open offices in a number of different cities where we had not formerly been and to look to expand the client base because there is very attractive, accretive business to be had in and among those clients. And I don't particularly view it as going downmarket, so much as expanding the aperture on in the case of investment banking, just the geography of where we are and what we're going to do and we're seeing sort of manifested success in that context. There were 10 notable transactions derived from an expanded footprint, which had meaningful P&L consequence to the business.In the context of the securities business, I would look at both equities and FICC and say that part of what sits in front of us and the leadership of that division is a changing skew on the customer base, which is looking at corporates as an expanded client set or customer set for both FICC and equity products. Marcus is obvious and self-evident in terms of that being a new consumer base for the firm more generally. And then I look at middle market lending, which sits in the I&L line. And as Marty alluded to, in the quarter, we generated $700 million of net interest income, which is recurring. It'll have a run rate of about $2.8 billion annually. And I view that as very stable, meaning if you look down the roster of loans that sit in that segment, they look very much like what you would find that big money center banks and it has not been to this point an area of focus for us. And we come at those clients not with a single product, but rather with a range of different products such that we sit at the top of the capital structure, in a better risk position, and avail these customers and clients of the kind of liquidity and access to capital they need.At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. -- Thank you. So since there are no more questions, I would like to take a moment to thank everyone for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team. We hope to see many of you in the coming months. If any additional questions arise in the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to Heather. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter call in January.Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Goldman Sachs third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by "
3 Attractive Dividend Stocks Whose Dividends Could Double,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 5:46PM
            
            ","Dividend stocks are attractive investments because they provide immediate income plus the potential for steady, and sometimes significant, stock-price gains. The best of these stocks also deliver market-beating growth in their dividend payouts, which helps supercharge an investor's long-term returns.Dividend stocks are attractive investments because they provide immediate income plus the potential for steady, and sometimes significant, stock-price gains. The best of these stocks also deliver market-beating growth in their dividend payouts, which helps supercharge an investor's long-term returns.With that in mind, below we'll take a closer look at three stocks -- , , and  -- that appear poised to at least double their dividends over the next few years.McCormick has issued solid payout raises to income investors over the last three years as the annual dividend climbed to $1.88 per share last year from $1.60 per share in 2015. But, considering recent operating trends, the spicing and flavorings giant could be preparing to speed up that dividend expansion pace.Sales over the first three quarters of 2018 are up 18% thanks to a  from the French's and Frank's brand portfolio it recently acquired. These condiments have helped lift gross profit margin up to a new high for the company, too, while improving its cash flow generation.Right now, McCormick is directing most of that cash toward paying down the $4 billion of debt it took on to fund its RB Foods buyout. But management plans to keep its incredible 32-year payout-boosting streak going while aggressively reducing its debt between now and 2020. At that point, its higher sales and profit base should allow for even faster dividend growth.Lowe's investors have gotten used to seeing the company live in the shadow of its more successful home improvement rival. Its sales growth and profitability both significantly lag , and that's not likely to change quickly even as the retailer welcomes a new CEO to its ranks. In fact, one of Marvin Ellison's first official acts as Lowe's new leader was to .Investors are optimistic that the changes Ellison is implementing, including an improved supply chain and better integrated online selling, will help the retailer close the gap with Home Depot over the next few years. In the meantime, its attractive dividend, which has more than doubled in five years, could grow more quickly with help from the company's new .Lowe's currently allocates about 35% of earnings to shareholders in dividends, and that payout rate has room to climb toward Home Depot's 55% -- if the company can start accelerating its sales and profit growth.Off-price retailing giant TJX Companies has raised its dividend in each of the last 24 years, which means it is quickly approaching the 25-year minimum requirement to qualify as a . The owner of the TJ Maxx and Marshalls brands hiked its annual payout 123% over the past four years, and income investors can now count on $1.56 per share from the company, up from $0.70 per share back in 2015.The future for this dividend looks just as bright. In August, the retailer announced a  in its sales growth rate while its profitability held steady. Combining those operating successes with a plunging tax rate explains why net income has risen 34% over the past six-month period.TJX's treasure-hunt shopping atmosphere resonates especially well with younger consumers, and that's a key reason why the company believes it can expand its physical store footprint  from 4,200 right now. Its long track record of boosting customer traffic also suggests it can continue soaking up market share over that time, which should help income investors reap solid returns from owning this retailer."
Domino's Pizza Inc (DPZ) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 2:55PM
            
            ","    Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call, Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.(Operator Instructions)Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Tim McIntyre to begin. Please go ahead. -- Thanks, Maria, and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today's call will highlight the results of our third quarter and will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Rich Allison and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence. I just said Rich Allison, I should have said Ritch Allison, sorry, oh my goodness -- CEO Ritch Allison, and CFO, Jeff Lawrence.This call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. A friendly reminder to our analysts; we have asked you to stick to one question on this call, because we want to give all 19 of you the chance to participate. We will provide each of you the opportunity for more in-depth one-on-one calls later today and tomorrow.In the event that any forward-looking statements are made, I refer you to the safe harbor statement you can find in this morning's release and the 8-K. In addition, please refer to the 8-K to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call.With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff Lawrence. -- Thank you, Tim, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued, as we once again delivered great results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 30 consecutive quarters of positive US comparable sales and 99 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our global store count at a healthy pace.Our diluted EPS was $1.95 which is an increase of 53.5% over the diluted EPS, as adjusted, in the prior year quarter, which excluded the impact of our recapitalization completed in 2017. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q3.Global retail sales grew 8.3% in the quarter. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 10.4%. This global retail sales growth was driven by increases in same-store sales and the average number of stores opened during the quarter. Same-store sales for the US grew 6.3%, lapping a prior year increase of 8.4%. And same-store sales for our international division grew 3.3%, rolling a prior year increase of 5.1%.Breaking down the US comp, our franchise business was up 6.4%, while our company-owned stores were up 4.9%. Both increases were driven primarily by higher order count in addition to some ticket growth, as consumers continue to respond positively to our overall brand experience.Our Piece of the Pie loyalty program once again contributed meaningfully to our traffic gains. Our international comp for the quarter was driven entirely by order count growth. During the quarter, comps in our Asia-Pacific, Americas and Middle East regions were strong. And while still positive year-to-date, the comp in our European business was slightly negative for the quarter.Our teams on the ground are working hard with our European franchise partners to regain comp momentum. Our retail sales growth in Europe remains strong due to healthy store count growth and we remain optimistic, long-term, in the business there.On the unit count front, we are pleased to report that we opened 59 net US stores in the third quarter, consisting of 61 store openings and 2 closures. Our international division added 173 net new stores during Q3, comprised of 192 store openings and 19 closures. On a total company basis, we opened 232 net new stores in the third quarter and 920 net new stores over the last 12 months, demonstrating the broad strength and attractive 4-wall economics our brand enjoys globally.Turning to revenues, total revenues were up $142.3 million or 22% from the prior year quarter. As a reminder, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we are now required to report the franchise contributions to our not-for-profit advertising fund and the related expenses gross on our P&L.Although this did not have an impact on our reported operating or net income in the third quarter, it did result in an $82.5 million increase in our consolidated revenues. It is important to note, although these amounts are included in our financial statements, they are restricted funds that can only be used to support the Domino's brand and are not available to be used for general corporate purposes.The remaining $59.8 million increase in revenues resulted primarily from the following. First, higher food volumes driven by strong US retail sales resulted in higher supply chain revenues. Second, higher US same-store sales resulted in increased royalties and fees from our franchise stores as well as higher revenues at our company-owned stores. Store count growth also contributed positively to these increases. And finally, higher international retail sales resulted in increased international royalty revenues, but were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.FX negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $1.9 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies. For the full fiscal year 2018, we now estimate that the impact of foreign currency on royalty revenues could come in near the low-end of our prior 2018 guidance of flat to positive $4 million. As you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rates which makes this a harder part of our business to predict.Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 37.6% from 30.8% in the prior year quarter. This increase resulted entirely from the recognition of domestic franchise advertising revenues on our P&L from the new accounting guidance I mentioned previously. Supply chain operating margin was negatively pressured by delivery and labor costs. Procurement savings partially offset these margin pressures.Our supply chain center operations in both the US and in Canada continue to have opportunities for improvement. We continue to invest heavily in both capacity and driving efficiencies in all of supply chain, and we remain committed to our franchise partners in making tangible headway in both capacity and efficiency in the near term. Company-owned store margin was negatively impacted by higher food, labor and insurance expenses as compared to the prior year quarter.G&A cost decreased $1 million as compared to the prior year quarter. This net decrease resulted primarily from a $5.9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of 12 company-owned stores, and a $4 million impact from the adoption of the revenue recognition guidance primarily related to the reclassification of certain advertising expenses out of G&A into domestic franchise advertising costs.These decreases were partially offset by continued investments in our marketing, supply chain and corporate store teams as well as our planned investments in technological initiatives, including e-commerce and the teams that support them. Please note that the company receives technology fees from franchisees that are recorded separately as franchise revenues.We currently estimate that our G&A cost for the full year 2018 will come in near the low-end of our previously communicated range of $370 million to $375 million. Keep in mind too that our G&A expense for the year can vary up or down based on, among other things, our performance versus plan, which affects variable performance-based compensation expense.Domestic franchise advertising costs were $82.5 million in the third quarter. As a reminder, we are now showing domestic franchise advertising in our revenues with an equal and offsetting amount of expense in our operating cost. Interest expense increased $800,000 in the third quarter, driven by increased net debt from our most recent recapitalization. This increase was largely offset by $5.8 million of incremental interest expense recorded in the prior year quarter related to our 2017 recapitalization.Our weighted-average borrowing rate was flat as compared to the prior year quarter at 4.1%. Our reported effective tax rate was 15.3% for the quarter, down significantly from prior year. This was primarily due to the lower federal statutory rate of 21% resulting from the federal tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017. The impact of tax benefits on equity-based compensation also resulted in a $7.4 million reduction in our third quarter provision for income taxes. This resulted in a 7.5 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate.We continue to expect that our ongoing tax rate, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation, will be 22% to 24%. We also expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to equity-based compensation. When you add it all up, our third quarter net income was up $27.7 million or 49% over the prior year quarter.Our third quarter diluted EPS was $1.95 versus $1.18 last year, which was a 65.3% increase. As compared to our prior year diluted EPS, as adjusted, of $1.27, our third quarter diluted EPS increased 53.5%. Here is how that $0.68 increase in diluted EPS breaks down. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.41, including a $0.31 positive impact from tax reform and a $0.10 positive year-over-year impact related to higher tax benefit on equity-based compensation.Lower diluted share counts, primarily as a result of share repurchases benefited us by $0.17. Higher net interest expense, resulting primarily from a higher net debt balance negatively impacted us by $0.09; foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.02; and importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.21 which includes $0.08 from the gain on the sale of company-owned stores.Now turning to our use of cash; during the third quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 397,000 shares for $109 million at an average purchase price of approximately $275 per share. Year-to-date, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.75 million shares for $429 million at an average purchase price of $245 per share.We also returned $23.2 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.55 per share quarterly dividend. All in all, our strong momentum continued and we are very pleased with our results for this quarter.And with that, I'll turn it over to Ritch. -- Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance and I'm extremely proud of our great franchisees and operators around the world, particularly within our US business who executed at high levels during the quarter. Our focus on global retail sales growth and franchisee economics continues to shape our steady, long-term strategy and approach.My first three months on the job have only reinforced my point of view about what it takes to succeed in this business; the brand with the best people, the strongest franchisee relations, a focus on forward-thinking innovation; and most importantly, the courage to take smart risks and tackle the steep hills needed to create meaningful change and improvement will win. I am very proud to be leading an organization that continues to play the long game by taking this winning approach.Focusing first on the US business, it was an outstanding quarter with strong retail sales growth driven by a solid balance of same-store sales and unit growth. The launch of Domino's Hotspots and the Paving for Pizza program both generated terrific attention and are two good examples of how we continue to make news for the brand in unique and different ways.We see these as more effective than the limited time offering, product of the month approach which differentiates us from others, not only in Pizza, but across the QSR landscape. We continue to drive healthy traffic in order counts and as always, remain focused on our own strategy and execution rather than specific competitive or macro factors.For years now, we've stressed the importance of franchisee profitability and cash-on-cash returns as important drivers of long-term growth for Domino's or any restaurant brand. Store openings are an obvious measure of the health of cash-on-cash returns, but it is also important to take a look at the rate of store closures.Closures are a key indicator of brand momentum and franchisee confidence. I am pleased to note that year-to-date in 2018, we have only closed seven stores in the US. I'm just going to repeat that; year-to-date in 2018, we have close just seven US stores while opening 140. I credit the many efforts related to sales and efficiencies made by our team and our franchisee-base toward the industry-leading unit economics that are keeping stores open and profitable.On our last call, we spoke about the need to accelerate supply chain capacity to support our industry-leading retail sales growth. I am pleased to report that during the quarter, we opened our new state-of-the-art supply chain center in Edison, New Jersey; the first Domino's US supply chain center to open in more than a decade.I am very pleased to see us making progress on these efforts to expand capacity. And as Jeff mentioned earlier, continuing to address needed efficiency improvements as we invest toward upgrading capabilities within our centers both old and new.I'd like to call out one more event during the quarter that makes a big statement about the strength of the Domino's brand. Stan Gage, a former member of the Domino's leadership team left Domino's and then became a 12 store franchisee in the Carolinas. Stan, in a familiar Domino's story, started as a driver more than 30 years ago and worked his way up through the company. Most recently he ran our company-owned stores.I note this not only because it is one more outstanding talent to add to our nearly 800 franchisees in the US today, but also because it shows ultimate confidence in the brand. Stan, we wish you all the best as you build your Domino's business.Many of you have told us we make this look easy at times, but the retail sales results, franchisee energy and momentum within our US system don't come easily. They take hard work each and every day. The US business results are driven by a system, culture and collection of franchisees and corporate team members that refuse to be complacent or to rest on past success. This collective energy and drive motivates me and my leadership team each and every day.Turning to the international business, we had a good quarter, generating strong retail sales growth and improving store growth trends across all regions. Three of our four regions delivered positive same-store sales with our Europe region being the exception. While there is work to do in a few key markets, overall, I continue to be very pleased to see our international same-store sales growth being driven by order growth.Across the international business, our master franchisees continue to perform at a very high level with excellent unit economics. We have the best master franchisee partners in the restaurant business and we will continue to work closely with them in driving home elements from the proven playbook used in the US and many other markets including, customer insights, franchisee alignment, technology innovation, and a clear focus on value and transaction growth as the main drivers of top line results. We are a work-in-progress brand and we will never rest in our quest to achieve a dominant number one position in every market where we compete.On the technology front, our Hotspots program was featured front and center this past quarter. Beyond any sales expectations at this early stage, the thing I'm most pleased with has been the incredible engagement from this program, with our customers, our franchisees and the media. Hotspots received much attention because it is a program that is completely unique within our industry.I couldn't be more proud at the store level execution of our franchisees and operators around the country as they delivered delicious Domino's Pizza to parks and beaches in more than 200,000 Hotspots across the US. Not all technology innovation is television commercial worthy and some that happens behind the scenes is as valuable as anything else. We continue to consider tech when discussing operational efficiencies with our franchisees, seeking to innovate and support their needs wherever possible. From this, we have recently incorporated voice and mobile capabilities into some of our store level activities, including inventory management and other areas.While not a customer facing digital platform, which I'm still pleased to see us doing plenty of, these launches can also drive value. We are constantly striving to create a better experience in our stores. Utilizing technology to benefit our franchisees, managers and store team members in ways that improve efficiencies and make their lives easier is something we will continue to do wherever and whenever possible.In closing, I am pleased with our third quarter results. As I mentioned during my opening remarks, I am very proud to be part of a brand with such a winning attitude and mentality, a winning strategy and approach and a winning collection of people that are, no doubt, the best in the industry. This is what gives me the upmost confidence that we can maintain our energy, momentum and success.And now, operator, we'll open it up for questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Co. -- Thank you, good morning guys. First question is, just when you look at the US business and you look at the fourth quarter last year, the comps of 4% in 4Q last year was still obviously very solid, but it also was a very clear temporary slowdown that we saw in the business. Can you just remind us what drove that temporary slowdown last year, so we can better understand your fourth quarter this year? Was it mostly driven by external issues or internal issues in the fourth quarter last year? -- Brian, we were pleased with the fourth quarter last year. The 4.2% was within our three to five year outlook that we've been giving you guys for quite some time and we don't see any material -- didn't see any material challenges back then that gave us a cause for concern. When we take a look at the momentum in the business this year and on a multi-year stack looking backwards, we're very, very pleased with the performance. -- Okay, and just in the international business, I know your Australian franchisee is going to be doing a conversion, how do you expect that to impact the international openings over the next few quarters? -- We are in the midst with our partner Domino's Pizza Enterprises of a conversion of Hallo pizza in Germany as we speak. So, Brian, that is a work in progress and conversions are -- been happening for several months now and will continue to go forward in the months to come. We won't comment on any specific unit count impact as it's an ongoing process. -- Okay, thank you Ritch.Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is the first quarter in a while that we've seen really only a moderate increase in year-over-year supply chain cost. Is there anything specific you would point to that's sort of helping the cost curve there? Is that early benefits of the new facility that's been opened in the US? Are you starting to see changes on the freight or shipping side of things? Really just any color there. -- Yes Karen, it's Jeff. In supply chain we've really taken our role as a franchisor. Seriously we're investing materially as you know, both in capability building as well capacity building. As Ritch mentioned in his prepared remarks, we were super excited to get our first supply chain center in more than a decade opened and running to our (inaudible) running down the line as we speak in Edison, New Jersey and that's something that we're going to continue to do.It's a great division. Guys are working really hard and our franchisees need that comfort that we're going to continue to get them high quality, safe food supply so that they have the confidence to continue to grow. They have that confidence in our supply chain. We're going to continue to invest again in even more capacity and more capabilities over time.As I mentioned, I believe it was last quarter we raised our guidance on CapEx for 2018 to reflect the fact and the optimism and where we're going in the US business to pull forward supply chain centers number two and three in the US. So, lot of opportunity for improvement there like we have in lots of parts of our businesses, but it's a great business, a good ROI and most importantly, getting good food supply to our franchisees in the US and Canada. -- Great, thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. -- Hey, I got two questions for Ritch. One is just a clarification, I think you said 3% to 5% long term algorithm, I think you meant 3% to 6%, just maybe clarify that. And then, the other question I had was just on the European sales and what the reason for the pressure there is and I guess what you're doing right now to address that market and maybe sort of bend the arc back? -- Sure, thanks Greg. And yes, you are correct, 3% to 6% is our three to five year outlook. So thank you for correcting me on that. First, around the business in Europe, our three other regions were very strong in Q3, but within the Europe region we've got a couple of markets where we've got some improvements to address and some of those are short term and some of those are going to take a little bit of time.When I take a look at the business over there, the issues that we have are by and large in our master franchisees control and we share a joint commitment to take whatever steps we need to get the business back to the performance on comps that we're all used to. If you take a look at it, holistically in Europe, I still feel very positive about our overall market position. We still have strong cash on cash returns across the region, and our retail sales growth performance has still been quite solid even in the face of a quarter where we didn't achieve the comp result that we'd like to see. -- Thank you very much.Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Baird. -- Hi, good morning. My question is on the domestic unit growth. I think this is maybe the seventh year in a row where the pace of growth has increased and I think that's probably an outcome of your fortressing strategy. But just wondering if you'd expect that pace to continue to move higher as we move forward and is it possible, in your view, that we could see domestic growth in line with your long run target for the global unit growth outlook? -- Sure David. We're very pleased with what has now been a multi-year acceleration of the pace of unit growth in the US. And certainly, the strategy of fortressing and driving retail sales growth plays a big part of that. Also, the fact that we have seen consistently improving over the last couple of years, store level profitability which, as we reported out to you has been in the mid-130s on a store level basis. That's driving a lot of confidence in the franchisee base in building new stores. You know you combine that with the fact that we've got a lot of stores out there in the US right now that are really busy.On Friday and Saturday nights, we've got some stores where we have a tough time putting an incremental pizza in the oven because they're so busy. Take all of that and you roll in a historically low rate of closures in the business and it's driven a nice acceleration and we're very optimistic about US store growth going forward. We've shared with you that we think the US, within a 10-year horizon, is an 8,000 store business. And so we're optimistic about the forward growth also. -- And Ritch, maybe a related follow-up. Are you seeing any signs of concern among the franchises related to the overall labor environment? I know the cash flows are still quite good but is there any sort of pause or concern you're seeing anywhere in the system in the US on development? -- I think labor is tight in any business in the US today and we're certainly no exception to that, with unemployment now under 4% for a while. But our franchisees out there are making it happen and they're hiring drivers. The fact that our drivers are so busy helps us. When we take a look at what a driver can make at a Domino's Pizza relative to delivering or driving for some other businesses, it's very, very attractive.But yes, labor pressures are certainly on the minds of -- on the minds of our franchisees. On the flip side of that, one of the things or the thing that drives sales of pizza, as much as anything, is having people gainfully employed and earning good wages out in the marketplace. So as the number one player in the pizza business, we also get a nice top side benefit from a strong labor market. -- Thank you very much.Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh of Stephens Inc. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. And this is actually Hugh on for Will this morning. I think this is really the first full quarter with the HotSpots now in, and can you provide any learnings from the program and maybe any color on the adoption or topline contribution from this program? -- Yes, HotSpots, it's been a really fun program for us. It's another one of our anywhere platforms with our goal of making Domino's Pizza accessible to our customers anytime and anywhere they want it. What I've been most pleased about on this is just the terrific brand engagement that we've seen on this platform and it starts with our franchisees who've set up these 200,000 plus HotSpots around the country. Our customers who've been excited about the program and also this has gotten a terrific amount of media attention as well which has been quite a bit of fun. So overall, we're quite pleased with the program. -- Thanks.(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI. -- Good morning. My question is on the G&A, when you back out that $5.9 million gain you had in the impact for ASC 606, your G&A dollars were up about $10 million in the quarter. Is that just a normal G&A increase or is there some sort of lumpiness in the quarter that that should go down. And just to confirm, the full year guide on G&A reflects that gain, meaning you went a little bit higher given that, that would have been an offset? -- Yes Matt, it's Jeff. The $370 million to $375 million remains the guide and that is inclusive of some of the noise that you see including the gains, so it's inclusive of that. We're guiding to the low end of that range or near the low end of that range, in part because of that gain that you saw from the store sales, so it kind of, I think, compensates for that a little bit.As far as the rate and pace, what we're probably going to continue to give you is just one year at a time is our best guess on what's going to go into G&A because we are in such a dynamic environment. We have been in periods where we've decided to accelerate some strategic investments if we see the opportunity in the marketplace. And so, given one year at a time is what we feel responsible to do now. So any one quarter, you might always get some bounce around things like that. But $370 million to $375 million is what we'll invest this year. Again, possibly at the lower end of that range.But again, if we outperform in Q4, that's going to go up. You have things like advertising that flows through on corporate stores and such. And if we underperform, we could be at even the lower end or below the range. So, I think the key point here is, is it continues -- the increases continue to go in strategic areas, it's in marketing, it's in analytics, it's in technology, it's in the things that are driving the profitable retail sales for franchisees around the world and that you're going to see more of, not less of, as we go forward. -- Okay, thank you.Our next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley. -- Thanks very much. Could you just talk a little bit about the US competitive environment? It's not lost on you or anyone on the call that one of your key competitors ceded some share this quarter but it's hard to see if you actually got a benefit or how much that benefit is, so -- and even what the store overlaps are? Can you can you talk about; one, the overall US competitive environment and the changes? But specifically to that comment on the competitor that's losing share, do you pick it up or is it too hard to measure, because from the outside, it's hard to see if you picked up share from that or not? -- Yes, John. We're in -- as you're aware, we're in a very fragmented category and if we have a competitor donating share, it doesn't simply fall in our pocket, we've got to earn it. And sometimes, share that's donated doesn't necessarily all fall into the pizza category as well and that specific competitor has a relatively small share within the category. So the impact of this on the overall landscape isn't necessarily as heavy as some might assume.When we take a look at the category overall, we're really more focused on our own competitive strategy than we are on kind of the short-term ups and downs with any specific competitor. And we think if we can continue to stay focused on bringing value to our customers and also on delivering terrific unit-level economics to our franchisees, we think we can continue to be successful and can continue to take share from competitors, small and large, in the pizza market. -- Got, it. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh of BTIG. -- Great, thanks. Yes, I want to circle back on the category as well. Can you guys talk a little bit about the growth of the pizza category? Have you seen that growth moderate or accelerate at all? And then also, anything you can discuss on the closure rate of some of your competitors, primarily the independent operators. Are you still seeing the closure rate accelerate and more closures in the system? -- Peter, first of all on the overall market, we aren't seeing any significant swings one way or another, on what is just a pretty steady low single-digit growth of the category in the US, and then globally the pizza category continuing to grow, we believe, in that 3% to 5% range. So no significant changes that we've seen there.With respect to closures, as I commented earlier, in our business, very strong unit-level economics have led to our franchisees maintaining confidence in keeping their stores open, seven closures across the entire US year-to-today.As you look elsewhere broadly across the industry, I don't have any specific comments about closures at competitors small or large, but what I will say is that overtime, my experience has always taught me that it's going to follow unit-level economics. And if we have players in the marketplace that are struggling to generate returns at the unit-level, then that's what's going to drive either closures on the downside or openings on the upside going forward. -- Alright, thank you very much.Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. -- Hi, thank you. Ritch, you mentioned both value (technical difficulty) economic to franchisees but I think sometimes in other systems we see those in conflict and the system struggle to stay on message around value because of franchisee pushback. So maybe could you just address how you're franchising about value and consistency in that $5.99 price point. Are there offsets that you're continually finding? Is it the mix stays sort of a fixed amount? Just trying to understand how you are able to be so consistent around value and others kind of float in and out? -- Sure. Sara, I think you used exactly the right word in your question, which was the word consistent and that's really been the key within our system. So we've been on our $5.99 mix and match which is our hero offer in delivery. We've been on that for effectively about nine years now. And in our carry-out business, for multiple years now, we've been consistently at our $7.99 offer there.And the key with value is consistency because it's really hard to offer those price points in the marketplace if you're not driving volume growth overtime. And you can't just jump on value for a quarter or for one promotional window and jump back out. That's just not a recipe to driving long-term transaction count gains in the business. And everything that we have experienced here at Domino's in the US and in our other large international markets is that, it is that transaction count growth over time that correlates not only with sales growth but with profit growth.And staying consistent and focused on that value has helped us to drive the kinds of unit level profitability numbers that you've seen from us over time. So consistency and alignment is the key. Franchisees also have levers at their fingertips as well with local menu pricing, with how they price their delivery charges et cetera that allow them outside of the national price point to manage pricing and some of the profit dynamics in their business at a local level as well, and we think that mix of a strong consistent national price point with flexibility at the local franchisee level is the recipe for a profitable and growing business. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull of Stifel. -- Thanks. Ritch, I had a follow-up regarding labor. Several restaurant companies have stated they are having difficulty fully staffing the restaurants in the current market, and obviously this becomes a major concern if it hurts your customer service. So, are you able to monitor whether franchisees are properly staffing restaurants and can you tell us whether customer satisfaction or drive time performance has changed much in recent quarters? -- We don't monitor franchisees staffing at the local level. They're independent business owners. And that's their job to track and manage their staffing at a local level. Certainly, as we look broadly across the business, service is critically important to us and it plays, Chris, into the fortressing strategy that we've been driving in the business.Getting our stores closer to the customer is going to help obviously with that service dimension, but also when we get our stores closer to the customer, our drivers can execute more runs per hour, because the distances are shorter and more runs per hour means happier customers and it also means more tips, which helps us to attract and retain delivery drivers into our business over time. -- Have you seen a decline in customer satisfaction or changes in it in recent quarters? -- No, we haven't seen any decline in customer satisfaction. -- Great, thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump of Longbow Research. -- I just had a question, I think about (inaudible) delivery providers. A, is that sort of have any have bigger impact from what you can see on your demand and then; B, kind of how do we model out increased labor costs from a driver standpoint that are most likely going to result, of course, of the growth in Easter party providers? -- Hey Alton, it's Jeff. On aggregators, we don't have that much more to add than what we've already said, been saying over the last 18 months to two years. It's more about what we're doing, our strategies, our great execution in more than 90 markets around the world, and we're -- as you see again we're hitting more often than not in that 8% to 12% global retail sales growth with really good flow through to the bottom line. So I don't think we have anything really to add to the conversation around this aggregator phenomenon other than to tell you that we're going to grow regardless. -- Okay, thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. -- Great, thank you very much. Just have a question on the unit growth. I mean it's hard to look at any system quarter-to-quarter, but there's a couple of quarters we've been sitting in the 6% range, which is the lower half, I guess of your 6% to 8% annual guidance and I recall last quarter there was talk about the international maybe coming in a little light of expectations.So I was wondering if you could talk about whether the third quarter results saw the uptick you were anticipating or whether there is any reason why we might see more modest growth or particular regions that might see more modest growth on the international front, although as it does seem to imply a pretty big uptick as we think about fourth quarter growth and just wondering to get your thoughts there specific to the international? -- Thanks, Jeff. First, keep in mind, that 6% to 8% unit growth outlook is a three to five year range in terms of outlook. Specifically related to the third quarter, we were pleased to see the pickup in international growth, 173 net units in the third quarter. We were pleased with what we saw there and when we take a look forward at the medium and the long-term, we've got solid unit economics across the international business and that's across all of the regions that we operate in and that is really the leading indicator of what is going to -- that gives us confidence in that 6% to 8% unit growth range that we give you on a global basis. And then, as we've talked about previously on this call, the unit level economics in our business in the US also continue to be very, very strong and at a level of returns that encouraged our franchisees to invest their hard earned dollars into building Domino's Pizza stores. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Scott of Mizuho. -- Hey, thank you. Good morning. Just bigger picture on international, the next 2,000, 3,000 stores versus the last 3,000 stores. Can you talk about the difference in contributions from your core market versus some of your younger markets that were launched in that 2013 to 2015 period when I believe Ritch you were leading the effort?I have your long-term store targets in front of me, but just thinking about the momentum over the next three years which markets may surprise us and accelerate versus those that -- where the growth might level out. And then maybe just a follow-up on the previous comment, you mentioned that you share a joint commitment to drive business in your international franchisees. Wondering if you can expand on that a little bit, is there a threshold of underperformance in a major market that would induce you to step up with capital support or is there something else that you had in mind? Thanks. -- Sure. Well, Jeremy, I'll start with your first question. When I think about the composition of store growth in international, the good news there is that it has been a pretty balanced portfolio of growth if you look overtime, in that we continue to get strong store growth out of long established core markets and you've seen that in the last couple of years in places like the UK and Australia for example, while also driving strong growth in some of the newer or more emerging markets that we've got around the world and you've seen a lot of units over the last couple of years come from places like India and Russia and Brazil and places that are relatively undeveloped for it.When I take a look forward, honestly I don't see a lot of change in that dynamic. We still have very attractive unit level returns in our core markets and also a good bit of wide space for growth in those markets. If you take a look at the top 15 markets that we operate in by unit count, there's still another 4,000 or 5,000 units of opportunity available in those places.And then beyond that, markets that wouldn't appear on that list, like places like, China and Russia and places like that, we're optimistic about the forward growth in some of those emerging markets as well. And having this balanced portfolio really helps us overtime, because frankly not all markets are going to be performing at any particular point in time, so you need that balanced portfolio to be able to consistently drive unit growth in that 6% to 8% range.I'll turn now to your second question. We have a really deep partnership with our master franchisees around the world and I think that is one of the things that has allowed us to be successful over a sustained period of time. So our teams work side by side with our master franchisee teams to make sure that we're driving the business forward with our customers in those marketplaces, but also working hand-in-hand on the unit level economics in the business as well.So, it's not so much stepping in with capital or other financial support as it is really making sure that we're taking the best of the learnings that we have whether that's from here in the US or from the more than 85 countries that we operate in and making sure that we don't repeat some of the same mistakes and making sure that we take advantage of those things that work. So that's how we look at it, is really a partnership that is driven by a shared set of expectations and a shared opportunity to create value for DPZ and for our master franchisees. -- Makes sense. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. -- Hi, thank you. Ritch, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about taking risk and climbing steep hills and I did think that in and of itself was an interesting quote. And then secondly, Jeff and I think it was you at -- perhaps in answer to a question that talked about looking at G&A one year at a time which I understand, but also you mentioned accelerating strategic investment.So I guess maybe I'm trying to connect two things that aren't necessarily directly connected, but what does that mean in terms of your future spend in G&A? Obviously this year $370 million to $375 million. But going forward, are you the organization at this point that wants to spend more-get more or are you beginning to think about potentially getting leverage out of the dollars spent that you're currently committed to? -- Yes John, this is Jeff. The first thing I would tell you is the overarching way that we view the business is to be front footed and really try to invest to get the gains that we want. We're not going to take our foot off the gas pedal and just hope that things continue to get better or we can continue to perform in a high fashion.We really want to make sure that we're targeted with incremental investments in the areas that we think are going to drive the consumer experience, drive great franchise economics; all those things rolled together, hopefully we can do double digit retail sales growth out into the next three to five years. We are not a brand that is going to circle a number and say, you know G&A must be this percentage of revenues or this percentage of retail sales. We think that that's limiting and we think that that ultimately -- if we had that kind of mentality over the last three, five, 10 years, we would not be sitting in a competitive position that we are today.So, we are going to continue to be front footed. We're going to continue to take smart risks. To Ritch's prepared remarks, I've been at the brand now for almost 19 years. I think the courage that Patrick, and now Ritch, have shown, our franchisees have shown to take on the really difficult challenges of the quick service restaurant industry and continue to fight through them and win is really energizing not only for the folks here in this building, but more importantly, the franchisees and team members in 90 markets around the world.So we're going to continue to be front footed. We're going to continue to try to make the right choices, but we're not going to run off the clock John. We are going to be aggressive and try to grow share. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle of Jefferies. -- Thanks, good morning. As you think about building traffic over the next couple of years, how do you envision the balance between building frequency of existing guests, where you've done a great job with loyalty and analytics versus the opportunity to accelerate growth in new customer visits and perhaps thoughts on how you go about identifying those groups and reeling them into the Domino's loyalists? -- Sure. Well, first and foremost the opportunity is there to continue to drive frequency among folks that buy from Domino's already. And when the loyalty program was first developed, our Piece of the Pie rewards program three years ago, the foundation of that program was built on driving frequency. That's why points are earned based on the number of purchases as opposed to the amount of dollars that are spent. So as we look across the landscape, we still see a significant amount of opportunity to get the customers who buy from us already to buy more.Also, getting trial is important as well and reducing these kinds of veto votes that may keep folks away from Domino's is important. That's one of the reasons that you saw one of the few product introductions that we've done over the last couple of years was salads and that was a way to attract potentially some customers and some households into the brand that maybe otherwise weren't using us before. But I see -- I still see lots of opportunity in driving frequency. -- Thanks.Our next question comes from line of Jon Tower from Wells Fargo. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. First, a clarification, I believe last year, at least according to my notes, there was roughly a 50 basis point headwind to US same store sales from the hurricanes. So first, is that correct? Second is, was there one this year from Florence? And then, the question is for Ritch, is there any sort of level of US market share that you feel like Domino's could get to or perhaps some other metrics that you're looking at where you'd consider monetizing the technology platform to other operators outside your franchise base? -- Hey Jon, this is Jeff. I'll take your comp/hurricane question and then I'll kick it over to Ritch for the second part of your question. The short answer is, last year and in this year we did not see a material either benefit or detriment to the US comp because of weather, including hurricanes or anything else. To the extent that we do see measurable stuff like that in the future, we'll point it out, but it's -- I know everybody in the industry likes to talk about weather when things aren't as good, but for us it wasn't either last year or this year, a material part of our comp performance. -- And then Jon, to the second part of your question on market share. One of the great things about this segment of the QSR industry is that, we as the market leader still only sell about one in six pizzas that are sold in the US and only about one in 15 that are sold outside the US. So I think there is significant headroom for market share growth.If you take a look at benchmarks across other segments of QSR whether you're looking at burgers or coffee or chicken or other places, the market leader is typically going to have a 25% or higher share and we see that in some of our own Domino's businesses around the world as well. So in my opinion, lots of room to continue to grow.And that's really where we're focused, is on continuing to do what we do really well. I like the fact that we have more than 300,000 people around the world wearing the Domino's logo who wake up every day and think about selling more Domino's Pizza. And as long as we've got a lot of runway for growth, I want to remain focused and not distracted by trying to take some elements of our business across to other brands or other sectors of the restaurant industry. -- Great. Thank you.Our final question comes from the line of Stephen Anderson of Maxim group. -- One comment you want to make is on your commodity outlook, I just want to see if there has been any change to that and if you're looking at any trends heading into 2019? -- Yes Stephen, this is Jeff. Our guidance for 2018, as you may recall, is 2% to 4% up on the food basket that our US franchisees are expecting. We're not updating that guidance at this point. Year-to-date we're in that kind of 3% to 4% range, so we're at the high end of that, but our franchisees have done a great job at executing at the local level, driving volume and continuing to drive really good dollar profit in their operations. So, no change to the food basket guidance in 2018. And as far as it relates to 2019, we're not giving any commentary or guidance on that today. -- Alright, thank you.Thank you ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ritch Allison for any additional or closing remarks. -- Well, thanks everybody, and we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on Thursday, January 17th, following the ICR Conference and we also look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results on Thursday, February 21st.Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by "
Here's Why Cerus Corporation Stock Popped Today,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 3:01PM
            
            ","Shares of Shares of  , a company focused on blood-transfusion safety, are on the move after the company reported preliminary third-quarter sales figures. The stock was up 15.8% as of 3:38 p.m. EDT.Cerus Corporation's Intercept Blood System is currently approved to reduce blood-borne pathogens in donated platelets and plasma. While these two markets are much smaller than the one for red blood cells, Cerus still managed to report  of strong sales growth.Third-quarter revenue reached $15.4 million during the third quarter, a 43% gain compared to the previous-year period. The rise inspired management to raise its full-year forecast to a range between $58 million and $60 million from a range of $56 million to $58 million. According to the company, there's still plenty of room to grow. Cerus Corporation thinks there's enough demand for transfusion-safety products to support a $1.2 billion market just within the geographic and product segments that the company already operates in. The market for red cells is expected to be even larger, and the company intends to submit for a CE mark in the EU later this year. Cerus didn't include all the details in its investor presentation today, so we don't know how much cash it has on hand. The company finished June with $112 million in cash and short-term investments after burning through $27 million during the first half of 2018. Strong sales growth will probably slow the cash burn rate going forward, giving the company a slight chance to reach profitability before running out of runway."
Can This Tiny Biotech Revolutionize a $35 Billion Market?,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 3:01PM
            
            ","Biopharmaceutical researchers at Biopharmaceutical researchers at   have set their sights on a big prize. They're developing a diagnostic test that could help identify millions of people at risk of liver failure because of nonalcohoic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as a therapy that may be able to resolve NASH. If they're successful, then Genfit could become a leader in a market estimated to be worth as much as $35 billion. To better understand the company's plans and progress, I recently spoke with Suneil Hosmane, the company's vice president of strategic development for the U.S. market. NASH, a liver disease that's caused by a high-calorie diet and a sedentary lifestyle, is fast becoming one of the most common causes of liver transplant in the developed world. In healthy patients, the liver contains less than 5% fat, but in patients with NASH, the percentage of fat can be much higher because these patients store excess calories in the liver. As more fat is stored in the liver, inflammation can cause cell damage that scars the liver, and if the scarring becomes too significant, then NASH can cause liver failure.Currently, there aren't any FDA-approved medications specifically for NASH, but the spread of western diets worldwide has industry watchers predicting that the market for any drugs that do make it to market be as big as $35 billion per year.After   reshaped hepatitis C treatment to curb liver damage with drugs that delivered functional cures generating tens of billions of dollars in annual sales, biopharma companies eager to duplicate the success have rushed to develop drugs for NASH that could be similarly successful.There are a number of companies conducting early-stage and mid-stage trials for NASH therapies, but only three are expected to have late-stage, phase 3 trial results available in 2019 that could result in an FDA OK. Trial data from Gilead Sciences' selonsertib and '  Ocaliva studies are  in the first half of next year, and Genfit expects results from its study of elafibranor by the end of next year.All three of these drugs work differently. Gilead Sciences' selonsertib is an apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor that reduces ASK1 activity to curb liver inflammation and scarring. Intercept's Ocaliva is a semisynthetic bile acid analogue FXR agonist that's already FDA-approved for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a disease affecting the bile ducts within the liver. And, Genefit's elafibranor is a dual agonist of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), which are ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. By activating PPARalpha, elafibranor can reduce triglycerides (natural fats and oils), and by activating PPARdelta, it can enhance the metabolism of fatty acid.When asked how Genfit plans to outmaneuver its competitors, Hosmane said the company's strategy is twofold. First, it wants to be first to market with a diagnostic test that can remove a big obstacle to identifying patients who may benefit from NASH treatment, and second, it wants elafibranor to be a first-line treatment option that could also be used alongside other NASH drugs with different mechanisms of action.The NASH diagnostic is particularly intriguing. A silent disease, NASH isn't often identified until patients present with late-stage liver disease, and currently, a diagnosis involves a liver biopsy. Liver biopsy is the gold standard; however, it's invasive, expensive, and isn't done in the primary care setting. Because most patients wouldn't be under the care of a hepatologist until their disease is advanced, millions of people that could benefit from intervention may be untreated for NASH.To overcome that problem, Genfit is developing a test that can identify biomarkers associated with NASH from a simple blood sample. If they're successful, it could provide a low-cost, non-invasive alternative to biopsy that could be used by doctors to test for NASH in patients with conditions that increase their risk of it, including type 2 diabetes. Hosmane says Genefit's plan is to roll out the test for use by researchers early next year, and if all goes well, the diagnostic could gain an FDA OK by 2020. An approval would be particularly interesting for investors because the diagnostic can conceivably be used by competitors as a companion diagnostic supporting the use of their drugs, too.Ideally, though, the approval of a diagnostic would drive eventual demand for elafibranor, but elafibranor will need to deliver positive results in its phase 3 trial first.In phase 2 trials, elafibranor's performance was arguably mixed. The trial failed to meet the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without a worsening of fibrosis (scarring) when compared to placebo; however, post-hoc analysis showed that it did better than placebo in patients with a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score equal to or greater than four, and those who responded to it did see a reduction in fibrosis. The post-hoc analysis suggests that elafibranor's inability to separate from placebo could have been due to trial design and uneven trial enrollment at clinical trial sites. Specifically, the inclusion of patients with limited disease may have dragged down efficacy because that subset had a higher placebo effect and faster-than-expected trial recruitment. According to Hosmane, these issues were carefully considered when designing the ongoing phase 3 study.If Genfit's post-hoc analysis did result in a phase 3 trial design that can deliver the goods, then interim data will allow the company to file for FDA approval when it's reported late next year. In the meantime, investors will want to keep an eye out for phase 2 trial data prior to the end of 2018 in PBC. If the company's PBC trial is a success, it could add conviction to the mechanism of action and provide Genfit with a second targeted indication with significant sales potential. There are limited treatment options available currently for PBC, and in the second quarter, Intercept reported sales of $43 million from Ocaliva's use in PBC, up from $30 million in the same quarter last year. Investors will also want to keep an eye on progress being made for Genfit's diagnostic, because if it's embraced widely, then it could be a treatment-agnostic source of revenue someday.Furthermore, it will be important to track how quickly Genfit is burning through its cash. In September, it reported trailing-six-month financials including $42 million in operating expenses and $275 million in cash, down from $317 million in cash on December 31 (at current euro to U.S. dollar exchange rates). In my opinion, the company will need to execute some form of a licensing deal, or tap investors for more cash at some point, if it hopes to successfully commercialize its pipeline. That's especially true if Genfit starts a phase 3 trial in PBC and expenses in preparation of a NASH launch accelerate.Investors should also consider that it isn't just Gilead Sciences and Intercept that Genfit may have to compete against someday. A number of other companies have therapies advancing toward phase 3 trials, including  and , which are both  selective thyroid beta receptor agonists that boost thyroid activity to improve metabolism and reduce fat.Ultimately, it could be combination therapies that become the standard of care in the indication, according to Hosmane. If so, I think there could be room for multiple players, partnerships, or outright acquisitions. It's anyone's guess, though, how this market will shake out -- or which of these companies' therapies will end up with the most compelling phase 3 results. Fortunately, we won't have to wait too long to find out. "
Why Helios and Matheson Analytics Stock Just Popped 26%,"
            
            Oct 16, 2018 at 2:48PM
            
            ","For For   stock, it's all over but the voting.Last month we told you about a plan by Helios and Matheson -- majority owner of MoviePass -- to once again reverse-split its stock, , in an effort to lift its share price up from about $0.02 to something more than the $1 minimum required to maintain a listing on the  Stock Market. Shareholders will vote on this plan on Thursday, and if the measure passes, Helios should be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq.Today, the chances of that vote succeeding increased measurably when independent proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) -- which advise shareholders on whether companies' proposed actions are good ideas or bad -- both decided that this latest plan by Helios is a good one.ISS said that the reverse split not only might allow Helios to maintain its listing on Nasdaq, but also ""the effective increase in the number of authorized shares would enable Helios to satisfy reserve requirements under certain convertible notes.""Glass Lewis said that it is in the company's best interest to reduce the number of shares outstanding in an attempt to raise the share price.In response, Helios and Matheson stock was up 26.1% as of 1:45 p.m. EDT on Tuesday.This is good advice. If shareholders vote down the reverse split on Thursday, and Helios shares remain priced at $0.02 (or less), the stock will almost certainly be delisted. Trading Helios stock will become more difficult, fewer investors will want to buy it, and with less demand, the stock price will fall.Conversely, a successful reverse split will at least temporarily keep alive the hope that Helios shares are worth something, and that they could one day be worth more.The shares might still not be worth a lot, however. MoviePass is not profitable, and I've yet to see anyone make a compelling case that it ever will be. It's burning cash, burdened with debt, and diluting existing shareholders with abandon through new stock issuances. Honestly, I don't see a very bright future for MoviePass even if the reserve split vote succeeds on Thursday.It's just that if the reverse split , the future will be even bleaker -- and probably shorter, too."
